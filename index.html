			Hello,
		</p>

		<p>
			This website presents an attempt to describe, in gory detail, 
            the operation of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe that the mind is principally defined by its memory,
            and the properties of that memory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Except where otherwise noted, all ideas presented here are my own. 
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, 
            and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each 
            essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to 
            complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
		</p>

        <p>
			Enjoy!
		</p>

            <strong>Saturday, January 16:</strong>
            Added new essay, <a href="theory/selfless-pursuits.html">Selfless Pursuits</a>, which
            rounds out the theory. Still a lot more to do: We must define fear in a meaningful way;
            we must associate fear with belief; we must associate the order of an ego with the number of
            beliefs it has.
            If possible, this theory should be expressed strictly in terms of "observation".
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Thursday, January 14:</strong>
            Reorganizing the work around the organization of intellect.
            For our purposes, it is less important "that" the mind
            achieves these states, and more important how.
            Discarded some more old work, and broke what remains into more 
            distinct components.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Tuesday, January 12:</strong>
            Settled on a name for the observation-evaluation-resolution
            sequence: <a href="./theory/thread.html">Thread</a>.
            Made the observation that <em>thought</em> is the vehicle
            by which the mind simplifies itself; included it in 
            <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a>.  
            May end up discarding <em>abstraction</em> as a fundamental
            operation; see 
            <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a> for more detail.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Monday, January 11:</strong>
            <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a>:
            Made more precise the model being considered.  
            Introduced an explanation of the diagram that was added yesterday.
            Removed references to precise and vague thinking:  They aren't
            of central interest to this discussion.
        </p>

        <p>
            While thought is the most interesting operation of the mind,
            it is not the "full workings". Rather, it is potentially
            a relatively small aspect of the operation of the mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, January 9:</strong>
            Continuing to work on <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a>.
            Reduced the content and restricted the definition to that which
            is most salient.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Wednesday, January 6:</strong>
            Marching right along with <a href="theory/thought.html">Thought</a>, and making improvements to <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.
            The definition of abstraction given is sufficiently
            restrictive that they cannot
            meaningfully be said to have "structure." Therefore,
            structure must be associated with thought; if the thought is a 
            true thought, then the resulting abstraction would effectively
            <em>carry</em> the thought's structure.
