		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			Hello,
		</p>

		<p>
			This website presents my attempt to describe the operation of the mind.
			I believe that all parts of the mind can be framed in terms of simplification.
			In other words, the human intellect can be understood as a
			memory mechanism of arbitrary complexity.
		</p>

		<p>
			I do not believe that the mind is a fundamentally complicated entity.
			It might be conceptually difficult, but that does not mean that it is
			operationally complicated.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>
