		<h1>Welcome</h1>

		<p>
			Hello,
		</p>

		<p>
			This website presents an attempt to describe, in gory detail, 
            the operation of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe that the mind is principally defined by its memory,
            and the properties of that memory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Except where otherwise noted, all ideas presented here are my own. 
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, 
            and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each 
            essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to 
            complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
		</p>

        <p>
			Enjoy!
		</p>

            <strong>Tuesday, January 12:</strong>
            Settled on a name for the observation-evaluation-resolution
            sequence: <a href="./theory/thread.html">Thread</a>.
            Made the observation that <em>thought</em> is the vehicle
            by which the mind simplifies itself; included it in 
            <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a>.  
            May end up discarding <em>abstraction</em> as a fundamental
            operation; see 
            <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a> for more detail.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Monday, January 11:</strong>
            <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a>:
            Made more precise the model being considered.  
            Introduced an explanation of the diagram that was added yesterday.
            Removed references to precise and vague thinking:  They aren't
            of central interest to this discussion.
        </p>

        <p>
            While thought is the most interesting operation of the mind,
            it is not the "full workings". Rather, it is potentially
            a relatively small aspect of the operation of the mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, January 9:</strong>
            Continuing to work on <a href="./theory/thought.html">Thought</a>.
            Reduced the content and restricted the definition to that which
            is most salient.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Wednesday, January 6:</strong>
            Marching right along with <a href="theory/thought.html">Thought</a>, and making improvements to <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.
            The definition of abstraction given is sufficiently
            restrictive that they cannot
            meaningfully be said to have "structure." Therefore,
            structure must be associated with thought; if the thought is a 
            true thought, then the resulting abstraction would effectively
            <em>carry</em> the thought's structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Monday, January 4:</strong>
            Continuing to work on <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.
            New definition of <em>true thought</em> in <a href="theory/thought.html">Thought and Belief</a>.
            In order to make this development mathematically sound, an 
            entity complimentary to <em>abstraction</em> must be introduced
            (namely, observation).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Thursday, December 31:</strong>
            Rewrote introductory section of <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>: Including both definitions of <em>abstraction</em> now.  
            A lot of new material in the works, just having trouble
            expressing it in a suitably formal manner.
            Have a happy new year!
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, December 26:</strong>
            Revised thoughts on <em>consciousness</em> in 
            <a href="theory/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, 
            and may have arrived at an elegant definition.
        </p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tuesday, December 22:</strong>
			Discarded <em>Processes</em>&mdash; I really had hope for them!
			Rewrote <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstractions</a> to reflect.
		</p>
		
        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, December 19:</strong>
            Nice little addition to <a href="theory/intellect.html">Intellect</a>.
            While Intellect is the most important component of this research,
            it is also the last, and, for any given mind, the most variable.
            In particular, <em>Intellect</em> is true with respect to ego
            (in the sense that if you have ego, then you must field intellect),
            but not otherwise, and the theory must reflect that.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Although I still like the definition of abstraction given, it is
			essential that observation and abstraction belong to the same
			process; it is therefore proving (more than a little) naive.  
			Moreover, it might even be a mistake to define that process
			explicitly, given that it may exist only implicitly within the mind.
