		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			Hello,
		</p>

<p>
        This website presents an attempt to describe, in gory detail, 
        the operation of the mind.
        Specifically, it seeks to explain, formally, the mind's intellect, 
        under the belief that such an explanation will allow us to 
        replicate it artificially.
</p>

<p>
        Before venturing into the theory itself, it may be worthwhile to
        affirm the most important and direct observations I have made 
        about the human intellect.  
        These motivate an ongoing pursuit, and promise its eventual conclusion.
</p>

<p>
        The first observation was that my own thoughts are not
        discrete, but instead follow a particular "semi-discrete" pattern.
        That is, it is not the case that one has a thought $A$, followed
        by a thought $B,$ where $A$ and $B$ are unrelated.
        Rather, <em>Every thought explicitly observes the previous thought.</em>
</p>

<p>
        The second observation was that this could be extended:
        Sophistication about the mind can be expressed as its ability
        to observe more than one previous thought.
</p>

<p>
        The above two observations found the entirety of this pursuit,
        and are to me unquestionable.  
        The only question has been how to express the situation formally.
</p>

<p>
        "Thought" is developed more formallly as <em>abstraction,</em>
        which, in turn, has been stated in terms of simplification or
        discarding.
	More, I have come to conclude that the mind is 
        principally defined by memory.
</p>

<p>
	Except where otherwise noted, all ideas presented here are my own. 
	I've been working on these ideas for some time, 
        and would like to put them into the public domain.
	Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each 
        essay to be up for review.
	Please feel free to comment, suggest, or critique. 
</p>

<p>
	Enjoy!
</p>

<h3> Changelog </h3>
<p>
        <strong>Friday, February 26:</strong>
        Did some writing, trying to make the work more cohesive/coherent.
</p>

<p>
        <strong>Tuesday, February 23:</strong>
        Minor addition to 
        <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>&mdash;
        intend to develop it as a data type, in addition to
        an ordered pair.
        Need to quit puzzling over individual abstractions and
        start considering abstracting functions, which, would just
        be a collection of abstractions.
</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Tuesday, February 2:</strong>
            Rewrote above introduction, recapitulating the origins of
            this theory.
            Continuing work on the foundations of this theory in
            <a href="theory/introduction.html">Introduction</a>:
            Added a new subsection, <em>A Model of the Mind's Memory.</em>
            Interesting questions regarding the interplay between 
            short-term and long-term memory.  
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Tuesday, January 26:</strong>
            Added axiom to <a href="theory/introduction.html">Introduction</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, January 23:</strong>
            Writing right along.
            Moved back (back back?) to threads/string/loops/knots, rather
            than threads/intellect/loops/ego.  The salient quality is
            the structure; its correspondence to the intellect must
            be regarded as secondary.
            Still much more to do.
            In particular, we must define an equivalence relation among threads.
        </p>
