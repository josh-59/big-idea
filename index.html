			Hello,
		</p>

		<p>
			This website presents an attempt to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe that the mind is principally defined by the 
            properties of the memory it
			contains (as opposed to its contents), 
            and the character of its consciousness. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Except where otherwise noted, all ideas presented here are my own. 
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>

            <strong>Wednesday, January 6:</strong>
            Marching right along with <a href="theory/thought-and-belief.html">Thought</a>, and making improvements to <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.
            The definition of abstraction given is sufficiently
            restrictive that they cannot
            meaningfully be said to have "structure." Therefore,
            structure must be associated with thought; if the thought is a 
            true thought, then the resulting abstraction would effectively
            <em>carry</em> the thought's structure.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Monday, January 4:</strong>
            Continuing to work on <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.
            New definition of <em>true thought</em> in <a href="theory/thought-and-belief.html">Thought and Belief</a>.
            In order to make this development mathematically sound, an 
            entity complimentary to <em>abstraction</em> must be introduced
            (namely, observation).
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Thursday, December 31:</strong>
            Rewrote introductory section of <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>: Including both definitions of <em>abstraction</em> now.  
            A lot of new material in the works, just having trouble
            expressing it in a suitably formal manner.
            Have a happy new year!
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, December 26:</strong>
            Revised thoughts on <em>consciousness</em> in 
            <a href="theory/introduction.html">Introduction</a>, 
            and may have arrived at an elegant definition.
        </p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tuesday, December 22:</strong>
			Discarded <em>Processes</em>&mdash; I really had hope for them!
			Rewrote <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstractions</a> to reflect.
		</p>
		
        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, December 19:</strong>
            Nice little addition to <a href="theory/intellect.html">Intellect</a>.
            While Intellect is the most important component of this research,
            it is also the last, and, for any given mind, the most variable.
            In particular, <em>Intellect</em> is true with respect to ego
            (in the sense that if you have ego, then you must field intellect),
            but not otherwise, and the theory must reflect that.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Although I still like the definition of abstraction given, it is
			essential that observation and abstraction belong to the same
			process; it is therefore proving (more than a little) naive.  
			Moreover, it might even be a mistake to define that process
			explicitly, given that it may exist only implicitly within the mind.
		</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Sunday, December 13:</strong>
            New definition of "model" in <a href="theory/thought-and-belief.html">Thought and Belief</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, December 12:</strong>
            Added first definitions of <em>ego</em> and <em>introspection</em>
            to <a href="theory/intellect.html">Intellect</a>.  
            Studying <a href="theory/processes.html#consciousness">Consciousness</a>;
            another failed definition.  However, this theory might reduce to 
            a study of memory and consciousness, with abstraction, intellect
            and ego being consequences of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, December 5:</strong>
            Continued to reduce content in <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.  
            Reintroduced <em>pure abstractions</em>.
            New essay, <a href="theory/thought-and-belief.html">Thought and Belief</a>;
            defined <em>true thought.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Getting somewhere, albeit slowly.  
            The phrase <em>discarding process</em> has a nice ring to it, 
            but suffers the minor malady that it cannot exist.  In the case
            that I am interested in, I expected to be able to guarantee the
            non-emptiness of its argument by including the process itself;
            however, from a pure-math perspective, this is rediculous.
