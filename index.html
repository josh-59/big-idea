			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			The principle vehicle for this is the process, a function without
			fixed points.
			Broadly speaking, the pattern about the deductive mind is to observe, reason, then conclude.
			I believe that each of these steps can be framed in terms of simplification, formally,
			abstraction.
			Through this website, those parts will be broken down and examined, and
			suitable formal theory will be built up.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like now to put them into the public domain.
			The material begins with the assumptions of the field of
			First Order Logic, namely, the existence of well-defined "objects,"
			in addition to some elementary theory of sets and functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The theory revolves around two new ideas: Processes, a kind of function; and, Abstraction, the process of simplification.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>

            <strong>Sunday, June 14, 2020:</strong> Continuing to write
            <a href="processes/founding-logic-with-abstractions.html">
                Founding Logic with Abstractions
            </a>.
            Changed the stated aim of the work to be a study guide.
            Wrote a bunch, but also left a bunch out.  For instance, I admit that
            <em>language</em> is required to make a proper study of logic, but
            have no intent of including one in the work.

            <strong>Saturday, June 13, 2020:</strong> Continuing to write
            <a href="processes/founding-logic-with-abstractions.html">
                Founding Logic with Abstractions
            </a>.
            I'm certainly unqualified to write a "book" on logic, but, 1) It's a free country, and 2) The discussion requires some context.  
            So, I kept it short.
        </p>

		<p>
			<strong>Friday, June 12, 2020:</strong>
			Reworking <a href="processes/founding-logic-with-abstractions.html">Founding Logic with Abstractions</a>.
			I hope that it will split off into a project of its own, another Creative-Commons booklike, tentatively
			called, "Thinking Logically."
			Reworded, and added a small amount of content to, <a href="processes/intellect.html">Intellect</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Thursday, June 11, 2020:</strong>
			Quickly developing the <a href="processes/founding-logic-with-abstractions.html">Founding Logic with Abstractions</a>
			essay.  As it turns out, the material in it has been on my mind for some time.
			Much more can be said about the subject the material covers now:
			The importance of indirection, the importance of being explicit,
			First Order Logic as the abstract consideration of all First Order Languages...
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Wednesday, June 10, 2020:</strong>
			A new essay,
			<a href="processes/founding-logic-with-abstractions.html">Founding Logic with Abstractions</a>.
			This will, eventually, be a single long essay; until then, I expect its content to change a lot,
			I can't recommend following along too closely.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Monday, June 8, 2020:</strong> A new essay,
			<a href="processes/thoughts-on-memory.html">Thoughts on Memory</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Saturday, May 30, 2020:</strong>  Discarded some old,
			principally anecdotal material.  It strikes me that the principle
			object that I should be concerned with is the bit-vector, rather
			than the set.
