		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			The principle vehicle for this is the process, a function without
			fixed points.
			Broadly speaking, the pattern about the deductive mind is to observe, reason, then conclude.
			I believe that each of these steps can be framed in terms of simplification, formally,
			abstraction.
			Through this website, those parts will be broken down and examined, and
			suitable formal theory will be built up.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like now to put them into the public domain.
			The material begins with the assumptions of the field of
			First Order Logic, namely, the existence of well-defined "objects,"
			in addition to some elementary theory of sets and functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The theory revolves around two new ideas: Processes, a kind of function; and, Abstraction, the process of simplification.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Thursday, May 21, 2020:
			Added a new diagram to <a href="processes/intellect.html">Intellects</a>, along with
			some (brief) new material.
			Added <strong>Formal Abstractions</strong> to <a href="processes/abstractions.html"> Abstractions </a> (at the end).
			Renamed my "other project," and updated <a href="about.html">About me</a> to reflect.
			Removed final paragraph from <a href="about.html"> About me</a>.
			Thought I was done with <a href="processes/bridges.html"> Bridges</a>, but that was not the case.
		</p>

		<p>
			Friday, May 15, 2020:
			After more than a month, finished the <a href="processes/bridges.html"> Bridges</a> essay
			(changes to end).
			After careful consideration, reverted "context" of a process back to "argument,"
			and "resolution" back to "result," (in <a href="processes/processes.html">Processes</a>);
			discarded "evaluation" because it is not observable.
			It was very promising to me to isolate thought by consideration of
			context; however, doing so discards any mathematical precision, which
			we require.
		</p>

		<p>
			Added fourth example to <a href="processes/processes.html">Processes</a>
			(and corrected the numbering of examples).
			Might define "abstraction of a set" to mean, "a subset of that set."
			Hopefully I will be able to discard "Fielding."
