		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			The principle vehicle for this is the process, a function without
			fixed points.
			Broadly speaking, the pattern about the deductive mind is to observe, reason, then conclude.
			I believe that each of these steps can be framed in terms of simplification, formally,
			abstraction.
			Through this website, those parts will be broken down and examined, and
			suitable formal theory will be built up.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like now to put them into the public domain.
			The material begins with the assumptions of the field of
			First Order Logic, namely, the existence of well-defined "objects,"
			in addition to some elementary theory of sets and functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The theory revolves around two new ideas: Processes, a kind of function; and, Abstraction, the process of simplification.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>

		<h3> Changelog </h3>
		<p>
			<strong>Monday, June 8, 2020:</strong> A new essay,
			<a href="processes/thoughts-on-memory.html">Thoughts on Memory</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>Saturday, May 30, 2020:</strong>  Discarded some old,
			principally anecdotal material.  It strikes me that the principle
			object that I should be concerned with is the bit-vector, rather
			than the set.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Thursday, May 28, 2020:</strong>
			A recap:  On the one hand, it's very nice to have the operation of abstraction
			formally defined (namely, taking a subset).  That operation seems
			to accurately reflect everything I know about abstractions, in a
			more precise manner;
			it "bodes" well with everyday use, and, simultaneously, it allows more
			precise thinking about them.  In particular, it works well when applied
			to, say, the set of features that an object has.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, we require a substantial, non-contradictory definition of abstractions
			within some greater mathematical "language", to make further progress.
			I'm loathe to give any part of this development up, but,
			some concession must be made.
			The least concession would be to allow a null process;
			that is, to discard processes in favor of functions.
			It's a little less pretentious, as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			Did a little work on "Order," in <a href="processes/looking-forward.html">Looking Forward</a>.
			Still learning about this mathematics language stuff.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Wednesday, May 25, 2020:</strong>
			Toned down the wording in <a href="processes/process-of-abstraction.html">The Process of Abstraction</a>;
			corrected link in changelog below.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Tuesday, May 24, 2020:</strong>
			Success!  <a href="processes/process-of-abstraction.html">The Process of Abstraction</a>.
			Removed commentary from <a href="processes/an-example-from-graph-theory">An Example From Graph Theory</a>.
			<a href=processes/looking-forward.html>Looking Forward</a> to expressing logic (specifically,
			deductive argumentation) in terms of abstraction and order.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Saturday, May 23, 2020:</strong>
			Rewrote a few paragraphs in Metaprocess section of <a href="processes/processes.html">Processes</a>.
			Rewrote some of <a href="processes/a_more_formal_view_of_thinking.html"> A More Formal View of Thinking</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Thursday, May 21, 2020:</strong>
			Added a new diagram to <a href="processes/intellect.html">Intellects</a>, along with
			some (brief) new material.
			Added Formal Abstractions to <a href="processes/abstractions.html"> Abstractions </a> (at the end).
			Renamed my "other project," and updated <a href="about.html">About me</a> to reflect.
			Removed final paragraph from <a href="about.html"> About me</a>.
			Thought I was done with <a href="processes/bridges.html"> Bridges</a>, but that was not the case.
