			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			I believe that all parts of the mind can be framed in terms of simplification.
			In other words, the human intellect can be understood as a
			memory mechanism of arbitrary complexity.
			The process, a function without fixed points, will serve as the
			mathematical foundation of this theory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>
