		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Hello,
		</p>

		<p>
			This website presents an attempt to describe, in gory detail, 
            the operation of the mind&mdash; specifically, the mind's intellect.
            The development will be concerned with the inalienable faculties of 
            the mind, its tendency to organize, a detailed description of 
            the structures of that organization, and justification of
            such organization.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe that the mind is principally defined by its memory,
            and the properties of that memory.
            Moreover, this development pursues the simplest possible explanation of
            the myriad complicated behaviors the mind is capable of.
		</p>

		<p>
			Except where otherwise noted, all ideas presented here are my own. 
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, 
            and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each 
            essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to 
            complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
		</p>

        <p>
			Enjoy!
		</p>

            <strong>Tuesday, January 25:</strong>
            Added axiom to <a href="theory/introduction.html">Introduction</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, January 23:</strong>
            Writing right along.
            Moved back (back back?) to threads/string/loops/knots, rather
            than threads/intellect/loops/ego.  The salient quality is
            the structure; its correspondence to the intellect must
            be regarded as secondary.
            Still much more to do.
            In particular, we must define an equivalence relation among threads.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Friday, January 22:</strong>
            Decided to change "thought" to the much more verbose "ratiocination".  
            Justification: We're not interested in <em>thought</em> in the abstract,
            but rather, its precise implementation at any one time.
            In the usual sense of the word "thought", thoughts exist in many
            forms, and we are interested in only one of these.
        </p>

        <p>
            Reconsidering the choice of word "intellect", as it presently
            has dual meanings: 1) An intuitively defined component of the mind,
            which we seek to describe, and 2) A formal component of intellect(1).
        </p>

        <p>
            Developing <a href="./theory/ego.html">Ego</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Monday, January 18:</strong>
            Rewrote above introduction, and added a subsection, <em>Axioms of the Mind's Memory</em>
            to <a href="./theory/introduction.html">Introduction</a>.  
            Interesting thoughts on introversion in <a href="./theory/todo">todo</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Saturday, January 16:</strong>
            Added new essay, <a href="theory/selfless-pursuits.html">Selfless Pursuits</a>, which
            rounds out the theory. Still a lot more to do: We must define fear in a meaningful way;
            we must associate fear with belief; we must associate the order of an ego with the number of
            beliefs it has.
            If possible, this theory should be expressed strictly in terms of "observation".
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Thursday, January 14:</strong>
            Reorganizing the work around the organization of intellect.
            For our purposes, it is less important "that" the mind
            achieves these states, and more important how.
            Discarded some more old work, and broke what remains into more 
            distinct components.  
        </p>
