		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			Broadly speaking, the pattern about the deductive mind is to simplify, reason, then conclude.
			I believe that each of these steps can be framed in terms of simplification.
			Through this website, those parts will be broken down and examined, and
			suitable formal theory will be built up.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like now to put them into the public domain.
			The material begins with the assumptions of the field of
			First Order Logic, namely, the existence of well-defined "objects,"
			in addition to some elementary theory of sets and functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The theory revolves around two new ideas: Processes, a kind of function; and, Abstraction, the process of simplification.
			I believe that all operations of the human mind can be expressed
			through the process of abstraction alone.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the function of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>
