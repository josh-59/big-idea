		<h1>Welcome</h1>

			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			The principle vehicle for this is the process, a function without
			fixed points.
			Broadly speaking, the pattern about the deductive mind is to observe, reason, then conclude.
			I believe that each of these steps can be framed in terms of simplification, formally,
			abstraction.
			Through this website, those parts will be broken down and examined, and
			suitable formal theory will be built up.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like now to put them into the public domain.
			The material begins with the assumptions of the field of
			First Order Logic, namely, the existence of well-defined "objects,"
			in addition to some elementary theory of sets and functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The theory revolves around two new ideas: Processes, a kind of function; and, Abstraction, the process of simplification.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>
