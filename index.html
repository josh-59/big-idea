			Dear Reader,
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this website is to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
			Broadly speaking, the pattern about the deductive mind is to simplify, reason, then conclude.
			I believe that each of these steps can be framed in terms of simplification.
			Through this website, those parts will be broken down and examined.
		</p>

		<p>
			Published here are ideas of my own.
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like now to put them into the public domain, for their own improvement.
			It's natural to think that research such as this belongs to academia, that this material should be completed first and then published as a thesis or other self-complete document.
			However, that approach, for me, repeatedly yielded monolithic publications that could never be completed.
			This website represents a different tack: To break the whole down into manageable pieces, and to focus on improving each of them, gradually.
			With persistence and feedback, I hope to yield a complete, cogent development.
		</p>

		<p>
			The theory revolves around two new ideas: Processes, a very general theory, and Abstraction, the process of simplification.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review; the function of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas, and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>
