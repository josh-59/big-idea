			Hello,
		</p>

		<p>
			This website presents an attempt to describe, in gory detail, the operation of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe that the mind is principally defined by the
			abstractions it fields.
			Since an abstraction is, intuitively, a simplification, this
			is equivalent to stating that the mind may be described
			by the characteristics of its memory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Except where otherwise noted, all ideas here are my own. 
			I've been working on these ideas for some time, and would like to put them into the public domain.
			Although I've done my best, I wish to consider each essay to be up for review;
			the purpose of the website is to motivate me to complete the exposition of these ideas,
			and to improve them through the criticism of others.
			Enjoy!
		</p>

            <strong>Saturday, December 5:</strong>
            Continued to reduce content in <a href="theory/abstraction.html">Abstraction</a>.  
            Reintroduced <em>pure abstractions</em>.
            New essay, <a href="theory/thought-and-belief.html">Thought and Belief</a>;
            defined <em>true thought.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Getting somewhere, albeit slowly.  
            The phrase <em>discarding process</em> has a nice ring to it, 
            but suffers the minor malady that it cannot exist.  In the case
            that I am interested in, I expected to be able to guarantee the
            non-emptiness of its argument by including the process itself;
            however, from a pure-math perspective, this is rediculous.
        </p>

        <p>
