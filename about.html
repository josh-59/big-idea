			My name is Josh Timmons, and I'm a mathematics student with an interest in computers.
			I started college a little late, taking a detour to serve in the U.S. Army.
			At 25 years old, I went off to college, originally pursuing mechanical engineering.
			Physics is not my strong suit, but math stayed with me; I wound up changing my major in my sophomore year.
			Within math, I like abstract algebra and mathematical logic.

		<p>
			As a mathematics major, I sought a minor in computer science to round out my education, earn credits and satisfy some curiosity that remained from childhood.
			After making a serious study of it in college, though, it became a passion.
			I like understanding how the machine works at the deepest levels relevant to the programmer, and I especially like writing about it.
      You should check out my other project, <a href="https://josh-59.github.io/Learning-Linux/"> Learning Linux!</a>

		<p>
			Finally, I wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development&mdash; specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
