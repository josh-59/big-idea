			My name is Josh Timmons, and I'm a mathematics student with a keen interest in computers.
      I started college a little late, taking a detour to serve in the U.S. Army.
      At 25 years old, I went off to college, originally pursuing mechanical engineering.
			Physics is not my strong suit, but math stayed with me; I wound up changing my major in my sophomore year.
			Within math, I like abstract algebra and mathematical logic.

		<p>
			As a mathematics major, I sought a minor in computer science to round out my education, earn credits and satisfy some curiosity that remained from childhood.
			After making a serious study of it in college, though, it became passion.
			I like understanding how the machine works at the deepest levels relevant to the programmer, and I especially like writing about it.
      You should check out my other project, <a href="https://josh-59.github.io/Need-to-Know/"> Need to Know!</a>

		<p>
			In college, an honest effort to learn and diligence regarding study has accrued into something I can be proud of:
			I currently have a GPA of 3.82, and will be graduating in the Spring.
