		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			My primary interest is in generating an artificial intelligence;
			along the way I've picked up too many ideas to develop them
			all to satisfaction.
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			We adopt the
			comparatively broad definition that a process <i>is conscious of</i>
			anything that it changes.
		</p>

		<h2> Order </h2>
		<p>
			A singular process need not execute in isolation.
			The <i>order</i> of a process is the minimum number of concurrently executing
			instances of itself.
			In particular, this affords the opportunity of <i>self</i>-consciousness.
		</p>

		<h2>Economy</h2>
		<p>
			One avenue for describing intelligence is simply the relative efficiency
			of a process, as compared to other processes.
			For instance, given two distinct cars, the one that is more
			fuel efficient is more intelligent than the other with respect to fuel.
		</p>

		<h2>Economization</h2>
		<p>
			A process is <i>economizing</i> if its execution alone implies an increase
			in efficiency;
			that is, learning is the first derivative of intelligence.
			Also note that learning <i>is a process</i>&mdash; it is consequence of
			a process which acts on itself.
			That is, learning implies self-consciousness.
		</p>

		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
		</p>

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One (inelegant) approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding suboptimal solutions).
		</p>

		<h2> Deferring </h2>
		<p>
			This idea is inpired by <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/221667/whats-the-point-of-duality"> this stack overflow answer </a>
			(which is, in turn, references a linear algebra text by Michael Artin's).
			The quote is a beautiful rendition of the concept of ignoring, and
			I expect to see the "deferring" of less-interesting thoughts to be a useful concept.
		</p>


		    <h2> Significance </h2>
		    <p>
		      Meaning strikes me as, "the difference it makes;" that is, significance
		      is the change implied (by a given thing).  It might be sufficient
		      to clause significance within a conditional.
		      My point is, if a given statement or artifact makes no change, then
		      it has no significance, and has no meaning.
		    </p>

		    <h2> Fear </h2>
		    <p>
		      Caring about what is not known; caring about what is not observed;
		      empty concern. Probably of more use within the context of processes / intellects.
		    </p>

		<h2>Schizo</h2>
		<p>
			A more elegant approach to generating a learning process would
			be to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distict lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<h2>Intellect</h2>
		<p>
			The term <i>intellect</i> is handy to refer to an arbitrary individual's
			conscious working mind.
			I think that intellects are abstracting processes of order <i>n &gt; 1</i>, so are self-conscious
			processes.
			In addition, intellects are "dimensional" processes, in the sense that
			each overarching abstraction is composed of a sequence of finer abstractions (of order possibly distinct from
			overarching order).
