		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<h2> Order </h2>
		<p>
			A singular process need not execute in isolation.
			The <i>order</i> of a process is the number of previous instances of itself
			that a process observes.
			In particular, this affords the opportunity of <i>self</i>-consciousness.
			Actually, this could provide a very elegant approach to the idea of <i>learning</i>,
			with "memory" or "memorization" being equivalent to very high order.
		</p>

		<h2>Economy</h2>
		<p>
			One avenue for describing intelligence is simply the relative efficiency
			of a process, as compared to other processes.
			For instance, given two distinct cars, the one that is more
			fuel efficient is more intelligent than the other with respect to fuel.
		</p>

		<h2>Economization</h2>
		<p>
			A process is <i>economizing</i> if its execution alone implies an increase
			in efficiency;
			that is, learning is the first derivative of intelligence.
			Also note that learning <i>is a process</i>&mdash; it is consequence of
			a process which acts on itself.
			That is, learning implies self-consciousness.
		</p>

		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
		</p>

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One (inelegant) approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding suboptimal solutions).
		</p>

		<h2> Significance </h2>
		<p>
			Meaning strikes me as, "the difference it makes;" that is, significance
			is the change implied (by a given thing).  It might be sufficient
			to clause significance within a conditional.
			My point is, if a given statement or artifact makes no change, then
			it has no significance, and has no meaning.
		</p>

		<h2>Schizo</h2>
		<p>
			A more elegant approach to generating a learning process would
			be to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distict lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<h2>Intellect</h2>
		<p>
			The term <i>intellect</i> is handy to refer to an arbitrary individual's
			conscious working mind.
			Namely, an intellect is a data structure implemented by repeated (and concurrent) instances
			of an abstracting process.
			In addition, intellects are "dimensional" processes, in the sense that
			each overarching abstraction is composed of a sequence of finer abstractions (of order possibly distinct from
			overarching order) (I expect between four and six of these "layers").
		</p>

		<h2> Identity Process </h2>
		<p>
			A sequence of non-identity processes might form zero change.
			This would result in a stable... <i>thing</i>.
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			A process which enacts change upon itself is conscious.
