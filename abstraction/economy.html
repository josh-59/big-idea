		<h1> Intelligence </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
      The word <i> intelligence </i> herein, denotes the economy of a process.
		</p>

    More intelligent with respect to X.
    Intelligence about a single process is noncomparable; that is, we require two or more processes to determine which is more intelligent.
    Moreover, we cannot consider a single process, taken alone, to be ``intelligent'' or not; it is simply a process, which does a thing and whose action consumes resources.

    The intelligence of a process is defined to be the ratio of change that it yields to an arbitrary resource it consumes.

    An example from computer science, sorting:
    Bubblesort,
    Mergesort,
    Quicksort.

    That is, given two distinct processes that make the same change, if one executes while consumingonsuming fewer resources than the other, then that is the more intelligent of the two.

    For example, given two different production lines, each producing comparable objects, the more efficient of the two is the more intelligent.

    This definition also has natural extensions to the human, and is useful in this capacity because it abstracts away from the individual and, specifically, their intellect.
    That is, by approaching the idea of intelligence from this paradigm, we do not have to concern ourselves with how one is doing something, but rather what the results are.
    For instance, consider two carpenters, each building a house.
    There are many ways to compare these two workers, but I believe that their relative efficiency of building the house (with respect to time, or money, or effort) is a description of their relative intelligence.
    That is, each builder chooses to be intelligent with respect to something-- Do things the easy way, if it's all the same; Do things quickly, if you're being paid by the job.
    	<< For instance, one says, "Ah, I'm very shortsighted, so that I shall be very very efficient with respect to money, at the expense of time and effort." This one nets less money, etc..>>

    -- Intelligence of an Intellect --
    Since learning is an activity of the mind, and is therefore a process, we define intelligence about an intellect to be the efficiency with which one can learn with respect to time.
    	<< WRONG.  This is comparatively impure; it clutters the space with intelligence about a particular kind of process being different from intelligence about processes in general. >>
    That is, a more intelligent intellect can learn faster-- where ``learn'' is construed to

    This is the most general definition of intelligence that we will entertain.

    That is, given two solutions to the same problem, the more efficient one is
    always superior.
