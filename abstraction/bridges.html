			The Funny Thing About Language

		<p>
			Languages are funny things:
			They exist in their own right, and yet
			they exist to facilitate something else.

			The Golden Gate Bridge, by Rich Niewirsoki Jr.
		</div>

		<p>
			If I were to give you a dictionary definition of a bridge, my point would be lost.
			We learn what bridges are in an informal matter, via experience.
			We learn to associate with each word a particular meaning, and this is done
			without the aid of the language we seek to learn.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we learn a natural language, though, using it is pretty, well, natural.
			The greatest, most significant meaning of a word is not necessarily
			its most absolute interpretation, but rather, it <i>tends to become</i>
			the most absolute interpretation.
			When an educated intellectual hears the word "bridge," for instance,
			I think that they think of the physical construct <i>first</i>.
			From this foundational, concrete idea, one abstracts until some semblence of meaning,
			some connection, is found.
			Without the physical notion of a bridge, there does not exist a basis for abstraction.
			The Golden Gate bridge above is an object; the idea of a bridge is an abstraction
			from like objects; through further abstraction, <i>bridge</i> becomes a metaphor.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="https://etymonline.com">Etymology</a> is the study of words, in particular, their origin and development.
			Abstraction is existant as a natural part of natural language, and can be seen in the progression of the meanings of
			ordinary words.
			Consider the term <i>lingua franca</i>, as defined in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition:
		</p>

		<div class="reprint">
			<b>Lingua Franca:</b>
			<ol>
				<li> A common language consisting of Italian mixed with Franch, Spanish, Greek, and Arabic that was formerly spoken in Mediterranean ports</li>
				<li> Any of various languages used as common or commercial tongues among peoples of diverse speech </li>
				<li> Something resembling a common language &lt;movies are the <i>lingua franca</i> of the twentieth century -Gore Vidal&gt;</i></li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			It's interesting to note that, just as the repeated abstraction of "bridge" loses specificity,
			so too does the expression <i>lingua franca</i>.
			The definition of the phrase began with <i>a...</i>, then became <i>any of...</i>,
			and finally, <i>something resembling...</i>.
			The intriguing aspect of languages, to me, is that you can both study them and use them,
			in much the same way that you can either admire the Golden Gate Bridge
			or simply cross it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Cast in this light, a language or a bridge is nothing more than a tool, something
			to be used.
			For whatever reason, this thought has been very persistent in my mind,
			enduring for months.
			In part, it applies to areas in which I am interested:
			Mathematics and computer science.
			In part, I am still learning to use the language of mathematics
			to express myself.
