		<h1> A More Formal View of Thinking  </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Here, we take another look at thinking.
			The idea that thinking is a process is introduced.
		</p>

    <p>
      Consider the polynomial function,
    </p>

    <div class="quote_text">
      f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>  - 4.
    </div>

    <p>
      Obviously, this is an ordinary mathematical function; however, computing its value at, say, <i>x = 3</i>, is a process.
      Specifically, it is a process over the set of all algebraic expressions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let <i>p</i> be the process of evaluating <i>f</i> at <i>3</i>.
      We break the evaluation of <i>f</i> into three distinct steps,
			and consider each state <i>i</i> before each process takes place and
			after each process takes place:
    </p>

    <div class="proc">
      p(0):<br><br>
      f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>  - 4;<br><br>
      x = 3
    </div>

    <p>
      The next step will be to replace the chosen value for the independant variable and discard the assignment, <i>x = 3</i>:
    </p>

    <div class="proc">
      p(1):<br><br>
      f(3) = 3<sup>2</sup> - 4
    </div>

    <p>
      Next, we begin following the rules of order of operation, and square first:
    </p>

    <div class="proc">
      p(2):<br><br>
      f(3) = 9 - 4
    </div>

    <p>
      Finally, we subtract four and obtain the desired result:
    </p>

    <div class="proc">
      p(3):<br><br>
      f(3) = 5
    </div>

    <p>
      At this point, evaluation has concluded, and the process has ended.
      Some notes from this example:
    </p>

    <p>
      First, the process of evaluating an arithmetic expression is implicitly broken down into constituent steps.
      In my opinion, we apply <i>the same</i> process (that is, <i>our</i> process) four distinct times, before we have completed the task.
      That is, the overarching change, from <i>p(0)</i> to <i>p(3)</i> is the result of an abstract (or meta) process;
      we implement this process by applying a more feasible process four distinct times.
    </p>

		<p>
			As I picture it,

			<center> <img src="3Process.png" style="width: 100%"> </img> </center>
		</p>

    <p>
      Abstraction is present in many forms in this process.
			At every step, we focus on one part of the expression, and ignore other parts;
			this is one form of abstraction.
			Replacing each expression in simpler terms (i.e., replacing <i>3<sup>2</sup></i> with <i>9</i>)
			is another form.
     	In step two, we discard <i>x=3</i> as unecessary; while it may continue to be true that <i>x=3</i>,
			it ceases to be relevant to the computation at hand after the value has been substituted, and the information is discarded.
    </p>

    <p>
			All processes make change.
			After making their change, the result of that process (the new or distinct state) remains unchanged until another process
			changes it.
			This can be placed within the process lifecycle as a "concluded" or "terminal" state by , for some nonzero length of time;
			this is the simplest state that the process can be in.
      After obtaining the result, <i>f(3) = 5</i>, that result sticks around until the individual discards it.
			This is true for each <i>step</i> of the process, as well: <i>p(1)</i> observes the result of <i>p(0)</i>;
			<i>p(2)</i> observes the result of <i>p(1)</i>, etc.
			Each of these "observations of the result of the previous process" could be reframed as abstraction from the previous process.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a nontrivial distinction between computers and ordinary human intelligence:
			After computation has taken place, if you were to ask a computer what the value of the expression is a second time,
			it would execute the same sequence of steps a second time, whereas a human would not.
			The result could be reframed as an abstraction of the computational process itself.
    </p>

		<h2> Conclusion </h2>
		<p>
			I do not feel that I've taken any gratuitous leaps with this assesment; I feel that this is a
			clear portrayal of what's more or less expected of individuals as they learn mathematics.
			It seems prudent to point out that I <i>am not</i> claiming that each state <i>p(i)</i> in the above process
			is a consequence of a single abstraction.
			Rather, I claim that the above process, and all activities of the human mind, can be implemented via abstraction alone,
			by considering and casting it in different lights.
			We will require more theory to discuss this intelligently&ndash; in particular,
			processes, the order of a process, and depth (or dimension).
