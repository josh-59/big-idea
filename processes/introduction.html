		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			We begin our investigation of the mind with the assumption that
			the mind is a component of the human body, where the body is
			separate from the world.
			Formally, we will call "the mind" an <em>intellect.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			If the human body has five senses, and a brain which interprets these senses, then
			the above must be an accurate depiction of the overarching role of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			The singular operation that will be entertained throughout this
			development is simplification; formally, we will call
			this operation <em>abstraction.</em>
			A single abstraction acts like a mathematical function, with input and output.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the abstraction is nontrivial, then the function has <em>distinct</em> inputs and outputs.
			If the abstraction is trivial, then no change has been made; this precludes
			such "operations" from investigation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Unlike a single abstraction, an intellect does not begin at one point and end at another.
			Rather, it exists between two connections, which are connected
			by something other than itself (above, that thing is denoted by "reality").
			In other words, an intellect observes the results of its own output;
			equally, an intellect indirectly interacts with its input.
		</p>

		<p>
			With the above constraints in mind, I will define the intellect
			to be a sequence of overlapping abstractions, each of which
			implicitly changes the intellect's abstracting process.
