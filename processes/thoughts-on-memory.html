		<h1> Thoughts on Memory </h1>
		<p>
			The importance of memory to this theory is difficult to overstate.
			It is my opinion, for instance, that to produce a general artificial intelligence,
			our goal is not to make the computer's
			central processing unit conscious or aware, but rather, to make the computer's
			memory conscious or aware.
			At the moment, my definition of consciousness centers around the process:
			A process is self-conscious if it interacts with itself.
			It is not infeasible to implement this in an otherwise-ordinary program.
		</p>

		<p>
			These initial, intuitive thoughts require investigation and development.
			Setting out, I found
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aseitqCZKQo"> this Youtube video</a>,
			an interview with Alan Baddeley, co-creator of
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baddeley%27s_model_of_working_memory">
				a model of working memory</a>.
			In this interview, Dr. Baddeley uses a classic example of apparent unconsciousness:
			Upon arriving at work after one's morning commute, one cannot remember
			"what happened," or how they got there.
			This being such a classic and intuitive example, I thought that it would
			warrant examination within the context of this theory.
		</p>

		<p>
			The human mind (intellect) is forgetting things all the time; that's the
			majority of what it does.
			In exactly the same way that one finds their morning commute forgettable,
			many things are forgettable, and as a consequence, one is effectively unconscious of them.
			The walls around me are white, for instance, but I am not conscious of
			them <em>in exactly the same way</em> that one is not conscious of one's daily commute.
		</p>

		<p>
			The key to this approach is triviality&mdash; the data is discarded
			as soon as it is observed.
			Why?
			One possibility is that it is discarded because it is expected; it never appears in
			"long term memory" because it is already there.
