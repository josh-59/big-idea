		<h1> Informal Abstractions of Formal Objects </h1>

		<p>
			In my opinion, abstracting from well-defined objects is the principle
			method by which mathematicians work with the entities of their field.
			That is, they consider parts of objects at a time.
			Much of mathematics is the act of pointing out facets of objects at appropriate times.
			If we all dealt with objects natively, proofs would be redundant.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, mathematicians, in my experience, do not wield set-based definitions of functions when they don't have to.
			They certainly can, and this is a pillar of their strength.
			In practice, though, they respect the definition of a function,
			but prefer to think of them as entities that are somehow active:
			A function <em>sends</em> or <em>maps</em> its argument to a value.
		</p>

		<p>
			This idea, that a function transforms, is a facet of functions, and when considered in isolation, becomes an abstraction of them;
			it is not an object because it is not precisely defined.
			Rather, it is a way of thinking about functions informally, and serves the purpose of allowing the mathematician to work economically
			with them.
			The experienced mathematician has built for themselves an informal interpretation of the definition of a function, sufficiently
			accurate for most occasions, and works principally with this.
		</p>

		<p>
			That is, the <i>means</i> of thinking is typically informal; it is interesting to note
			that this is, with respect to any mathematics at hand, always irrelevant,
			because mathematics is a subject concerned with objects.
			Just like a proof by counterexample, in which we leave out any work involved in producing an appropriate example,
			we leave out the informal process of thought by restricting our written language to what is formally relevant.
