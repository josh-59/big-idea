	<h2> Formal </h2>

	<p>
		<a href="abstractions.html"> Abstractions </a> &ensp;
		An abstraction is a simplification;
		abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
		The existence of an abstraction implies the existence of an abstracting process.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="processes.html"> The Process </a> &ensp;
		This paper introduces the process, a function without fixed points.
		All processes make change;
		a process is a set of changes.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="economy.html"> Economy </a> &ensp;
		This paper introduces the notion of the economy of a process,
		how efficiently it carries out its change.
		Economy will form our formal foundation for
		intelligence.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="intelligence.html"> Intelligence </a> &ensp;
		Building upon economy and order, we can begin to make formal
		statements about intelligence.
	</p>

	<p>
	<a href="reasonable.html"> Reasonableness </a> &ensp;
		This paper begins to build, formally, on processes.
	</p>

	<p>
	<a href="intellect.html"> Intellect </a> &ensp;
		My target object.  This will be an "abstracting engine".
	</a>
	</p>

	<h2> Anecdotal </h2>

	<p>
		<a href="bridges.html"> Bridges </a> &ensp;
		Languages are funny things:
		They exist in their own right, and yet
		they exist to facilitate something else.
		When do you have <em>enough</em> of a bridge?
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="a_more_formal_view_of_thinking.html">A More Formal View of Thinking </a> &ensp;
		Here, we take another look at thinking.
		The idea that thinking is a process is introduced.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="abstraction_in_action.html"> Abstraction in Action </a> &ensp;
		In this essay, an example of thinking by way of
		abstraction is presented.
	</p>

	<p>
	<a href="tracing_objects.html"> Processes Tracing Objects </a> &ensp;
		Some demonstrations of the way that a process can be used to "create" an object are presented.
	</p>



    <p>
      <a href="looking-forward.html"> Looking Forward </a> &ensp;
        This development takes time, and I thought I would post the parts of the theory which I look forward to.
