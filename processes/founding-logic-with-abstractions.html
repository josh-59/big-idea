		<h1> Founding Logic with Abstractions </h1>
		<p>
			My other project, <a href="https://josh-59.github.io/Learning-Linux/">Learning Linux</a>,
			has been remarkably successful in teaching me about Linux.
			In addition, it's taught me to read works of all kinds, because the struggle in writing well
			about Linux has been in using language to express ideas, where the ideas are well-founded, and the language is variable.
			It struck me that a similar pattern was forming in my study of logic: That my own thoughts on logic
			exist, but are not sufficiently defined to be unambiguous, and therefore,
			my progress in learning the subject has stalled, somewhat.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, I endeavor to recapture the success of the Learning Linux project, in the study of logic.
			The two books I'm reading on logic are, <em>Language, Proof and Logic</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., by Barker-Plumer et al., and
			<em>An Introduction to Logic</em> by Patrick Suppes; I mention this because these, together, form the
			foundation of my assumptions about logic.
			<em>Language, Proof and Logic</em> is a contemporary work on the subject of logic; moreover,
			because it is the work of three authors, I feel that it represents well the subject as it
			is taught today.
			<em>An Introduction to Logic</em> was written in 1957; although it is comparatively dated,
			Patrick Suppes is a remarkable author, to such an extent that the many more modern renditions of
			the same material strike me as secondary sources, by comparison.
		</p>

		<p>
			We begin with objects, namely, because this is where I choose to begin; in addition,
			they are assumed in Section 1.1 of LPL:

			<div class="quote_text">
				"Individual constants are simply symbols that are used to refer to some fixed individual object."
			</div>
		</p>

		<p>
			So what is an object?  I say that an object is a well-defined abstraction.
			This means that it is a simplification (intuitively, a subset of all observable facets) of something else, with the caveat that
			it is unique:  There is exactly one.
			Through the individual constant, objects can be named, and thereby referred to.
			Objects transcend language:  They belong to the mind alone.
			There may be many names for a given object, or there may be none.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's worth giving a few examples of objects, before proceeding.
			For instance, a pen is an object, as is a book.
			In particular, we make no distinction between objects that can be "realized by"
			some physical entity and those that cannot.
			Therefore, the color <em>blue</em> is an object just as much as <em>a bottle</em> is an object.
		</p>

		<p>
			This uniformity is justified in large part by my interpretation of mathematics:
			The number <em>two</em> is an object (amongst mathematicians, this is beyond dispute),
			and the number two is not "realized by" any physical entities.
			Rather, it is a well-defined abstraction, which we
			laboriously consider as though it really existed.
		</p>

		<p>
			In order to speak about objects, we use names.
			Once given that objects may be named, there are a few things that one can say about objects them.
			The most basic thing that one can say is that two names
			<em>refer to the same</em> object; this is done through the much-maligned
			equals sign, more appropriately thought of as <em>identity</em>:
		</p>

		$$
		a = b
		$$

		<p>
			says that $a$ refers to the same object as $b.$
		</p>

		<p>
			Both objects and names are mainstays of first-order languages;
			concurrently, <em>identity</em> is often included in first-order languages.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another thing one can say about objects, which the developments of
			logic given above do not touch upon, is that one object may be contained in
			another object.
			Tentatively, we will define this as the <em>is</em> relation.
			We define:
			For any two objects $a$ and $b$, "$a$ <em>is</em> $b$" is true if and only
			if $b$ is a correct abstraction of $a.$
		</p>

		<p>
			This is used in natural language to make statements like, "That bottle is blue."
			The abstraction denoted by "bottle" contains the abstraction "blue,"
			and "blue" is a correct abstraction of the bottle;
			we might say things like, "Hand me that blue thing over there."
		</p>

		<p>
			Better yet, consider a bottle of peanuts&mdash; we might say,
			"Hand me those peanuts," when we mean, "Hand me that jar of peanuts."
