		<h1> Founding Logic with Abstractions </h1>
		<p>
			My other project, <a href="https://josh-59.github.io/Learning-Linux/">Learning Linux</a>,
			has been remarkably successful in teaching me about Linux.
			In addition, it's taught me to read works of all kinds, because the struggle in writing well
			about Linux has been in using language to express ideas, where the ideas are well-founded, and the language is variable.
			It struck me that a similar pattern was forming in my study of logic: That my own thoughts on logic
			exist, but are not sufficiently defined to be unambiguous, and, therefore,
			my progress in learning the subject has stalled, somewhat.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, I endeavor to recapture the success of the Learning Linux project, in the study of logic.
			The two books I'm reading on logic are, <em>Language, Proof and Logic</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., by Barker-Plumer et al., and
			<em>An Introduction to Logic</em> by Patrick Suppes; I mention this because these, together, form the
			foundation of my assumptions about logic.
			<em>Language, Proof and Logic</em> is a contemporary work on the subject of logic; moreover,
			because it is the work of three authors, I feel that it represents well the subject as it
			is taught today.
			<em>An Introduction to Logic</em> was written in 1957; although it is comparatively dated,
			Patrick Suppes is a remarkable author, to such an extent that the many more modern renditions of
			the same material strike me as secondary sources, by comparison.
		</p>

		<p>
			We begin with objects, namely, because this is where I choose to begin; in addition,
			they are assumed in Section 1.1 of LPL:

			<div class="quote_text">
				"Individual constants are simply symbols that are used to refer to some fixed individual object."
			</div>
		</p>

		<p>
			So what is an object?  I say that an object is a well-defined abstraction.
			This means that it is a simplification (a subset of all observable facets) of something else, with the caveat that
			it is unique; there is exactly one.
			Through the individual constant, objects can be named, and thereby referred to.
			Objects transcend language:  They belong to the mind alone.
			There may be many names for a given object, or there may be none.
