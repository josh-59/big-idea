		<h1> Intelligence </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			This paper introduces the notion of the economy of a process,
			how efficiently it carries out its change.
			Economy will form our formal foundation for
			intelligence.

			A process is intelligent if it is learning.
			A process is learning if its execution alone implies an increase in
			efficiency.
			This paper looks at the various ways in which the common
			housecat could be considered intelligent.
		</p>

		<h3>Efficiency</h3>
		<p>
			A process is learning if it gets better at what it does.
			This is sufficiently broad to capture the common intuitive notion
			of learning; our task is to consider and describe this formally.
		</p>

		<p>
			Given that <i>x</i> is an arbitrary resource, we define
			the efficiency of a realized process <i>p(a)</i> with respect to
			some quantifiable resource <i>x</i> as, <i>(p(a))/x</i>.
			If <i>p(a)</i> uses no <i>x</i>, then we define the efficiency
			of <i>p(a)</i> with respect to <i>x</i> to be infinite.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that we have not precluded <i>x</i> from being instances of
			the process itself; that is, "efficacy" can be phrased
			in terms of efficiency.
			Also, for each realized process <i>p(a)</i>, and each resource <i>x</i>,
			the efficiency of <i>p(a)</i> with respect to <i>x</i> is defined.
			This allows the comparison of relative efficiency between
			two arbitrary processes.
		</p>

		<h3>Learning</h3>
		<p>
			A process is <i>economizing</i> if its execution alone implies an increase
			in efficiency; this is my interpretation of "learning."
			Ultimately, learning is the first derivative of efficiency.
			Note that learning <i>is a process</i>&mdash; it is a process on
			the fielding process itself.
			As a consequence, it is subject to the above formal descriptions.
		</p>

		<h3>Second Derivative</h3>
		<p>
			The second derivative of efficiency may also gainfully be considered.
			This is the change in the rate of learning, and
			will be called <i>cognisance</i>.
			For instance, one might pick up new study habits, and thereby
			increase the efficiency of one's study.
		</p>

		<p>
			Already, we have enough formal theory to make nontrivial statements
			about the differences in intellects around us.
			For instance, a common housecat is <i>learning</i>, but is
			noncongnizant.
			It does not plan to learn; it does not study; it does not study
			its study.
