		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<h2> Order </h2>
		<p>
			A singular process need not execute in isolation.
			Strictly speaking, we define order with respect to a realized process.
			Suppose $p$ is a process, and let $p(a)$ be a realization of that process.
			Then the <em>order</em> of $p(a)$ is the number of
			instances of $p$ extant in the argument of $p(a)$.
		</p>

		<p>
			"extant in" was chosen because I'm choosing to focus my attention
			on the process of abstraction.



			This choice means that the "order" of any process is
			well-defined, without introducing "time."
		</p>

		<p>
			Of any given sequence of processes, the first will always be zero-order.
			In addition, a realized process in such a sequence
			will increase in order by at most one, relative to the previous process.
		</p>

		<p>


		<p>
			When speaking about sequences of realized processes that are stable with respect to order,
			we will characterize them by the order of their
			normative realized process.
			So,

		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
			Being clever <em>can increase</em> intelligence, but is not
			guaranteed to do so.
			This will be phrased formally as concurrence among processes.
		</p>

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One (inelegant) approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding suboptimal solutions).
		</p>

		<h2>Schizo</h2>
		<p>
			A more elegant approach to generating a learning process would
			be to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distict lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<h2>Intellect</h2>
		<p>
			My target object is the intellect, a self-conscious, learning
			process of order <i>n > 0</i> and depth <i>k > 3</i>, I believe.
			I think that the mind is, effectively, a data structure.
			Specifically, it is a data structure which is <i>active</i>,
			as opposed to <i>static</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, I think that it is a data structure which operates in
			<i>O(0)</i> (Big-Oh-Zero) time; that is, it is infinitely
			economizing.
			As a conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			an "AI" as think of them).
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			A process which can enact change upon itself is conscious.
		</p>

		<h2> Meaning </h2>
		<p>
			Meaning strikes me as, "the difference it makes;" that is, significance
			is the change implied (by a given thing).  It might be sufficient
			to clause significance within a conditional.
			It isn't enough to be <em>convincing</em>; without consequence, a
			statement is meaningless.
			This "convincingness" is seen across domains: In the pursuit of
			mathematics for its own sake, when it is curious and "true," but
			without application.
		</p>

		<p>
			My point is, if a given statement or artifact makes no change, then
			it has no significance, has no meaning, and is not a process.
			As yet, this development of "meaning" is general, and without
			direction.
		</p>

		<h2> Sincerity </h2>
		<p>
			Concurrence among active processes; dependant upon "order."
			Both this and "meaning" are context-driven.
		</p>

		<h2> Context-Driven </h2>
		<p>
			A process is context-driven if the change it makes is
			dependant upon the context in which it is applied.
			For instance, the the successor function <em>is not</em>
			context-driven, for at each input, it simply adds one.
			On the other hand, the squaring function over the positive
			integers is context-driven.
		</p>

		<h2> Physical Processes </h2>
		<p>
			We define a <i>physical process</i> as a process on physical
			states.
			By definition, the change that a process makes is nonzero, and
			both the argument state and the resulting state are well-defined.
			Therefore, a physical process has duration.
		</p>

		<h2 id="deductive-logic"> Deductive Logic </h2>
		<p>
			To describe deductive logic (in a "forward" direction), we will
			require only two things:  1) Abstraction and 2) Order.
			Abstraction to simplify, and order to connect distinct chains of
			simplifications.
