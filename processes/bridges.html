			The Funny Thing About Language

		<p>
			Languages are funny things:
			They exist in their own right, and yet
			they exist to facilitate something else.
			When do you have <em>enough</em> of a bridge?

			The Golden Gate Bridge, by Rich Niewirsoki Jr.
		</div>

		<p>
			If I were to give you a dictionary definition of a bridge, my point would be lost.
			We learn what bridges are in an informal matter, via experience.
			We learn to associate with each word a particular meaning, and this is done
			without the aid of the language we seek to learn.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we learn a natural language, though, using it is pretty, well, natural.
			The greatest, most significant meaning of a word is not necessarily
			its most absolute interpretation, but rather, it <i>tends to become</i>
			the most absolute interpretation.
			When an educated intellectual hears the word "bridge," for instance,
			I think that they think of the physical construct <i>first</i>.
			From this foundational, concrete idea, one abstracts until some semblence of meaning,
			some connection, is found.
			Without the physical notion of a bridge, there does not exist a basis for abstraction.
			The Golden Gate bridge above is an object; the idea of a bridge is an abstraction
			from like objects; through further abstraction, <i>bridge</i> becomes a metaphor.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="https://etymonline.com">Etymology</a> is the study of words, in particular, their origin and development.
			Abstraction is existant as a natural part of natural language, and can be seen in the progression of the meanings of
			ordinary words.
			Consider the term <i>lingua franca</i>, as defined in Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition:
		</p>

		<div class="reprint">
			<b>Lingua Franca:</b>
			<ol>
				<li> A common language consisting of Italian mixed with Franch, Spanish, Greek, and Arabic that was formerly spoken in Mediterranean ports</li>
				<li> Any of various languages used as common or commercial tongues among peoples of diverse speech </li>
				<li> Something resembling a common language &lt;movies are the <i>lingua franca</i> of the twentieth century -Gore Vidal&gt;</i></li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<p>
			It's interesting to note that, just as the repeated abstraction of "bridge" loses specificity,
			so too does the expression <i>lingua franca</i>.
			The definition of the phrase began with <i>a...</i>, then became <i>any of...</i>,
			and finally, <i>something resembling...</i>.
			In exactly the same way that you can either admire the
			Golden Gate Bridge, or simply cross it, one can either study
			a language or simply use it.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my opinion, the foundation of all thought is informal.
			Mathematics is the assumption of our own naivety, and nothing more.
			Pure mathematics demands that we spell out each component, each
			definition, each assumption, but <em>how</em> that is stored
			or represented in the mind is outside the domain of mathematics.
			It simply doesn't care because it simply doesn't matter.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just before the initial publication of this material, I
			spent a lot of time trying to sort out the difference between
			an <em>abstraction</em> and an <em>object</em>.
			And, the difference, it turns out, is how you use it:
			The "object" interpretation puts the entity first, much as one would
			admire or study the Golden Gate Bridge.
			The "abstraction" interpretation puts something else first, much
			as one would blithely cross a handy bridge.
		</p>

		<p>
			Math doesn't do that "blithely cross" thing, and that
			is what threw me off.
			Other fields do, notably, physics (to enormous effect).
			For instance, consider Newton's Second Law, as presented in
			<a href="https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1">
			OpenStax University Physics Vol 1 (Free)</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			On page 219, we find,
		</p>

		<center><h4> Newton's Second Law of Motion </h4></center>
		<p>
			$$ \vec{a} = \frac{\vec{F}_{net}}{m}$$
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, we are using mathematics (in particular, vectors) as our language.
			In that language, we are making a statement.
			From this statement, we will abstract (giving, for instance,
			the Law of Conservation of Momentum).
		</p>

		<p>
			In exactly the same way, I seek to describe the operations of the mind.
			It's often struck me, of late, that this amounts to generating a language,
			that the results we seek are contingent upon our ability to
			express them.
		</p>

		<p>
			To that end, this development may be right, or it may be wrong, but
			it is certainly the case that <em>with the right language,</em>
			the conclusions will be obvious.
