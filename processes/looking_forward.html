		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<h2> Order </h2>
		<p>
			A singular process need not execute in isolation.
			The <i>order</i> of a process is the number of previous instances of itself
			that a process observes.
			In particular, this affords the opportunity of <i>self</i>-consciousness.
			Actually, this could provide a very elegant approach to the idea of <i>learning</i>,
			with "memory" or "memorization" being somehow equivalent to very high order.
		</p>

		<h3>Efficiency</h3>
		<p>
			A process is learning if it gets better at what it does.
			This is sufficiently broad to capture the common intuitive notion
			of learning; our task is to consider and describe this formally.
		</p>

		<p>
			Given that <i>x</i> is an arbitrary resource, we define
			the efficiency of a realized process <i>p(a)</i> with respect to
			some quantifiable resource <i>x</i> as, <i>(p(a))/x</i>.
			If <i>p(a)</i> uses no <i>x</i>, then we define the efficiency
			of <i>p(a)</i> with respect to <i>x</i> to be infinite.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note that we have not precluded <i>x</i> from being instances of
			the process itself; that is, "efficacy" can be phrased
			in terms of efficiency.
			Also, for each realized process <i>p(a)</i>, and each resource <i>x</i>,
			the efficiency of <i>p(a)</i> with respect to <i>x</i> is defined.
			This allows the comparison of relative efficiency between
			two arbitrary processes.
		</p>

		<h3>Learning</h3>
		<p>
			A process is <i>economizing</i> if its execution alone implies an increase
			in efficiency; this is my interpretation of "learning."
			Ultimately, learning is the first derivative of efficiency.
			Note that learning <i>is a process</i>&mdash; it is a process on
			the fielding process itself.
			As a consequence, it is subject to the above formal descriptions.
		</p>

		<h3>Second Derivative</h3>
		<p>
			The second derivative of efficiency may also gainfully be considered.
			This is the change in the rate of learning, and
			will be called <i>cognisance</i>.
			For instance, one might pick up new study habits, and thereby
			increase the efficiency of one's study.
		</p>

		<p>
			Already, we have enough formal theory to make nontrivial statements
			about the differences in intellects around us.
			For instance, a common housecat is <i>learning</i>, but is
			noncongnizant.
			It does not plan to learn; it does not study; it does not study
			its study.
		</p>

		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
			This will be phrased formally as concurrence among processes.
		</p>

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One (inelegant) approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding suboptimal solutions).
		</p>

		<h2>Schizo</h2>
		<p>
			A more elegant approach to generating a learning process would
			be to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distict lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<h2>Intellect</h2>
		<p>
			My target object is the intellect, a self-conscious, learning
			process of order <i>n > 0</i> and depth <i>k > 3</i>, I believe.
			I think that the mind is, effectively, a data structure.
			Specifically, it is a data structure which is <i>active</i>,
			as opposed to <i>static</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, I think that it is a data structure which operates in
			<i>O(0)</i> (Big-Oh-Zero) time; that is, it is infinitely
			economizing.
			As a conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			an "AI" as think of them).
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			A process which can enact change upon itself is conscious.
		</p>

		<h2> Significance </h2>
		<p>
			Meaning strikes me as, "the difference it makes;" that is, significance
			is the change implied (by a given thing).  It might be sufficient
			to clause significance within a conditional.
			My point is, if a given statement or artifact makes no change, then
			it has no significance, has no meaning, and is not a process.
		</p>

		<h2> Sincerity </h2>
		<p>
			Concurrence among active processes; dependant upon "order."
		</p>

		<h2> Physical Processes </h2>
		<p>
			We define a <i>physical process</i> as a process on physical
			states.
			By definition, the change that a process makes is nonzero, and
			both the argument state and the resulting state are well-defined.
			Therefore, a physical process has duration.
