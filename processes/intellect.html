		<h1>Intellect</h1>
		<p>
			My target object is the intellect, a self-conscious, learning
			process of order <i>n > 0</i> and depth <i>k > 3</i>, I believe.
			I think that the mind is, effectively, a data structure.
			Specifically, it is a data structure which is <em>endlessly economizing</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, I think that it is a data structure which operates in
			<i>O(0)</i> (Big-Oh-Zero) time; that is, it is infinitely
			economizing.
			As a conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			an "AI" as we think of them).
		</p>

		<p>
			A single abstraction has distinct inputs and outputs;
			it begins at one point and ends at another.
			An intellect does not.
			In particular, an intellect would observe the results of
			its own output (or, put the other way around, would interact with its input).
			The following depicts reality as an intermediary layer between
			output and input.

		<p>
			If the human body has five senses, and a brain which interprets these senses, then
			the above must be an accurate depiction of the operation of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			Conceptually, the intellect is a pattern of thinking.
