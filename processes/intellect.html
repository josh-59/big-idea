		<h1>Intellect</h1>
		<p>
			My target object is the intellect.  Tentatively, it is defined as
			a self-conscious, learning process of order $n > 0$ and depth $k > 3$.
			Conceptually, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
			In particular, we do not care about <em>the content</em> of thought, in
			the definition of intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			A single abstraction has distinct inputs and outputs;
			it begins at one point and ends at another.
			An intellect does not.
			In particular, an intellect would observe the results of
			its own output (or, put the other way around, would interact with its input).
			The following depicts reality as an intermediary layer between
			output and input.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the human body has five senses, and a brain which interprets these senses, then
			the above must be an accurate depiction of the overarching role of the mind,
			the computational component of which is denoted with <em>intellect</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The singular operation of the intellect is simplification.
			This says that the mind's only operation is to (selectively) remember.
			If we deny that the mind has any genuine "creative" capacity, this
			conclusion is forced upon us.
		</p>

		<h2> As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect has been as a
			particular kind of data structure.
			Intuitively, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing,
			forever simplifying.
			Formally, it would be expressed as operation in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
			Continuing the conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			a "General Artificial Intelligence").
