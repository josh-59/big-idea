		<h1>Intellect</h1>
		<p>
			My target object is the intellect, a self-conscious, learning
			process of order <i>n > 0</i> and depth <i>k > 3</i>, I believe.
			I think that the mind is, effectively, a data structure.
			Specifically, it is a data structure which is <i>active</i>,
			as opposed to <i>static</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, I think that it is a data structure which operates in
			<i>O(0)</i> (Big-Oh-Zero) time; that is, it is infinitely
			economizing.
			As a conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			an "AI" as think of them).
