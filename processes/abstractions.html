		<h1>Abstractions</h1>

		<hr>
		<p>
			An abstraction is a simplification;
			abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
			The existence of an abstraction implies the existence of an abstracting process,
			and the existence of some observable phenomenon.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 1: <i>f</i>&ensp;is a function </h2>
		<p>
			Often, the first description of a function that a student encounters is that it's like a machine:
			You plug in a number, turn the crank, and, since <i>f</i> &nbsp;is a function, a unique value pops out.
			This is an abstraction of functions:  It preserves the notion that a function acts on an argument and returns
			a unique value, while ignoring the symbolic baggage usually associated with definitions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The abstraction above is intended as a bridge:  It gets the student working
			with functions with a so-far accurate description.
			Eventually, this description will be discarded (the "bridge" will be crossed), and
			the student will be expected to adopt a formal definition of the object.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several fields provide great numbers of good examples of abstractions.
			In my experience, the clearest ones are found in computer science, where abstraction is extremely important
			(it helps to manage complexity), and is necessarily defined in digital terms.
			I also wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development, specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 2: The C Programming Language </h2>
		<p>
			C is an imperative programming language, providing abstractions of both memory and functions.
			The imperative programming style is characterized by writing functions to carry out tasks, thereby breaking up a complex task into a sequence of function calls that each carry out a simpler task.
			Intrinsic to this process is the abstraction away from these functions; they are written, tested, and then used to more easily create more sophisticated programs.
		</p>

		<p>
			For any given subroutine, we abstract away from the implementing code by creating and naming the function uniquely.
			With this definition in hand, we simplify our mental picture to a ''black box'' that carries out a given task.
			It is important to the imperative programming paradigm <i>to forget</i> how it works:
			Ignoring the implementing details hides the complexity of the whole.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 3: An Automobile </h2>
		<p>
			Abstractions come in all shapes and sizes, and also vary widely in both precision and accuracy.
			Often, one abstracts out of necessity.
			For instance, even an ordinary car cannot be conceived of in totality.
			Rather, we abstract away from it.
			We might say, "There's something wrong with the engine."
			And a mechanic might respond with, "Ah, you need a new exhaust."
			We tend to work with only as much information as we must, and our vehicle for doing this is the abstraction.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the physical science, abstractions are very precise, and are called <i> models</i>, a term we will borrow later on.
			From <a href="https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/1-1-the-scope-and-scale-of-physics"> OPENSTAX University Physics Volume 1, page 14</a>,
			"A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display correctly."
			Continuing with our car example, we might model its position by considering it to be a point;
			similarly, we might simplify its changing velocity (which may involve extremely complex interactions within the vehicle)
			to a function over time.
			From this, we can draw conclusions about the car.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 4: Statement Logic </h2>
		<p>
			As a mathematics student, I have studied propositional logic more than once.
			For me, it is very much an intellectual tool:  Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement: I, the mathematician, can view any statement <i>as a proposition</i>, and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This immediately recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic, where substantial and relevant theory exists.
			Concurrently, the mathematician uses this theory to his or her advantage.
			That is, my concern with the subject of logic is not the field itself, but rather what the field can tell me about the situation at hand.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 5: Propositional Logic </h2>
		<p>
			The transitive law of implication is a commonly used rule in
			propositional logic.  It states that, given "A implies B", and
			"B implies C", we may conclude "A implies C."
		</p>

		<p>
			The above reasoning is an act of abstraction:
			We are discarding statement <i>B</i> in its entirity.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			In order to found this work on a bedrock of sanity, I have collected a few definitions of the word <i>abstraction.</i>
		</p>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>1</h3>

				<p>
					"... <i>abstraction</i>: A simplification of something much more complicated that is going on under the covers."
				</p>

				<p>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>2</h3>
				<p>
					"Abstraction hides detail."
				</p>

				<p>
					John V. Guttag, <i> Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition.</i>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>3</h3>
				<p>
					"An <b>abstraction</b> [sic] is a view or representation of an entity that includes only the most significant attributes."
				</p>

				<p>
					Robert W. Sebesta, <i>Concepts of Programming Languages</i> 11<sup>ed</sup>.
				</p>

		<p>
			It is my belief that the entirety of the human mind can be
			specified through the process of abstraction alone.
		</p>

		<h2>Formal Abstractions</h2>

		<p>
			If $X$ is a set, then an abstraction of $X$ is a subset of $X$.
		</p>

		<p>
			If $X$ is a sequence, then an abstraction of $X$ is a subsequence of $X$.
