		<h1>Abstractions</h1>

		<hr>

		<p>
			An abstraction is a simplification;
			abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
			The existence of an abstraction implies the existence of an abstracting process,
			and the existence of some observable phenomenon.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 1: <i>f</i>&ensp;is a function </h2>
		<p>
			Often, the first description of a function that a student encounters is that it's like a machine:
			You plug in a number, turn the crank, and, since <i>f</i> &nbsp;is a function, a unique value pops out.
			This is an abstraction of functions:  It preserves the notion that a function acts on an argument and returns
			a unique value, while ignoring the symbolic baggage usually associated with definitions.
			Because it both preserves and ignores, it serves to highlight.
		</p>

		<p>
			Abstractions may or may not be formally (i.e., precisely) defined.
			The example above is not precisely defined.
			Moreover, for any given object, there may be many distinct abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several fields provide great numbers of good examples of abstractions.
			In my experience, the clearest ones are found in computer science, where abstraction is extremely important
			(it helps to manage complexity), and is necessarily defined in digital terms.
			I also wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development, specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 2: The C Programming Language </h2>
		<p>
			C is an imperative programming language, providing abstractions of both memory and functions.
			The imperative programming style is characterized by writing functions to carry out tasks, thereby breaking up a complex task into a sequence of function calls that each carry out a simpler task.
			Intrinsic to this process is the abstraction away from these functions; they are written, tested, and then used to more easily create more sophisticated programs.
		</p>

		<p>
			For any given subroutine, we abstract away from the implementing code by creating and naming the function uniquely.
			With this definition in hand, we simplify our mental picture to a ''black box'' that carries out a given task.
			It is important to the imperative programming paradigm <i>to forget</i> how it works:
			Ignoring the implementing details hides the complexity of the whole.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 3: An Automobile </h2>
		<p>
			Abstractions come in all shapes and sizes, and also vary widely in both precision and accuracy.
			Often, one abstracts out of necessity.
			For instance, even an ordinary car cannot be conceived of in totality.
			Rather, we abstract away from it.
			We might say, "There's something wrong with the engine."
			And a mechanic might respond with, "Ah, you need a new exhaust."
			We tend to work with only as much information as we must, and our vehicle for doing this is the abstraction.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the physical science, abstractions are very precise, and are called <i> models</i>, a term we will borrow later on.
			From <a href="https://openstax.org/books/university-physics-volume-1/pages/1-1-the-scope-and-scale-of-physics"> OPENSTAX University Physics Volume 1, page 14</a>,
			"A model is a representation of something that is often too difficult (or impossible) to display correctly."
			Continuing with our car example, we might model its position by considering it to be a point;
			similarly, we might simplify its changing velocity (which may involve extremely complex interactions within the vehicle)
			to a function over time.
			From this, we can draw conclusions about the car.
		</p>

		<p>
			Abstractions are best seen as intellectual tools.
			They ignore detail to articulate more succinctly the kernel of a given object, as it pertains to an arbitrary concern.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 4: Statement Logic </h2>
		<p>
			As a mathematics student, I have studied propositional logic more than once.
			For me, it is very much an intellectual tool:  Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement: I, the mathematician, can view any statement <i>as a proposition</i>, and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This immediately recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic, where substantial and relevant theory exists.
			Concurrently, the mathematician uses this theory to his or her advantage.
			That is, my concern with the subject of logic is not the field itself, but rather what the field can tell me about the situation at hand.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			In order to found this work on a bedrock of sanity, I have collected a few definitions of the word <i>abstraction.</i>
		</p>
		<br>

		<center>
			<div class=box>
				<h3>1</h3>

				<p>
					"... <i>abstraction</i>: A simplification of something much more complicated that is going on under the covers."
				</p>

				<p>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>2</h3>
				<p>
					"Abstraction hides detail."
				</p>

				<p>
					John V. Guttag, <i> Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition.</i>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>3</h3>
				<p>
					"An <b>abstraction</b> [sic] is a view or representation of an entity that includes only the most significant attributes."
				</p>

				<p>
					Robert W. Sebesta, <i>Concepts of Programming Languages</i> 11<sup>ed</sup>.
				</p>
			</div>

		</center>

		<p>
			Abstractions are simplifications; abstracting represents simplification.
			Preserving relevant information is the task of the task of the intellect, and not the responsibility of the abstraction.
			In this way, each abstraction is a component of a thought.
		</p>

		<h2> Informal Abstractions of Objects </h2>

		<p>
			In my opinion, abstracting from well-defined objects is the principle
			method by which mathematicians work with the entities of their field.
			That is, they consider parts of objects at a time.
			Much of mathematics is the act of pointing out facets of objects at appropriate times.
			If we all dealt with objects natively, proofs would be redundant.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, mathematicians, in my experience, do not wield set-based definitions of functions when they don't have to.
			They certainly can, and this is a pillar of their strength.
			Rather, they respect the definition of a function, but prefer to think of them as entities that are somehow active:
			A function <i>sends</i> or <i>maps</i> its argument to a value.
		</p>

		<p>
			This idea, that a function transforms, is a facet of functions, and when considered in isolation, becomes an abstraction of them;
			it is not an object because it is not precisely defined.
			Rather, it is a way of thinking about functions informally, and serves the purpose of allowing the mathematician to work economically
			with them.
			The experienced mathematician has built for themselves an informal interpretation of the definition of a function, sufficiently
			accurate for most occasions, and works principally with this.
		</p>

		<p>
			That is, the <i>means</i> of thinking is typically informal; it is interesting to note
			that this is, with respect to any mathematics at hand, always irrelevant,
			because mathematics is a subject concerned with objects.
			Just like a proof by counterexample, in which we leave out any work involved in producing an appropriate example,
			we leave out the informal process of thought by restricting our written language to what is formally relevant.
		</p>

		<h2> Evaluation in terms of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			The transitive law of implication is a commonly used rule in
			propositional logic.  It states that, given "A implies B", and
			"B implies C", we may conclude "A implies C."
		</p>

		<p>
			We are discarding statement <i>B</i> in its entirity.
