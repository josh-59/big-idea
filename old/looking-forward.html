		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
			Being clever can increase intelligence, but is not
			guaranteed to do so.
		</p>

		<p>
			A problem with <em>being clever</em> is that, even if you are successful,
			you are projecting your current self into the future; you are
			denying yourself the ability to learn from the situation as it develops.
			This is fine in areas that do not change, such as mathematical calculations, chess, etc,
			but is not necessarily of practical value.
		</p>



				<h2>Conflict</h2>
				<p>
					A few thoughts on conflict:
				</p>

				<p>
					First, I think that conflict is the impetus for all
					action.
					The ideal conflict/resolution scenario is, I think, like scratching an itch:
					The conflict is minor, and its relief rewarding.
					On the other hand, a poor conflict/resolution scenario might be,
					scratching a scab:  Relieving the itch exacerbates the situation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Second, when there are multiple, coexisting and opposing conflicts, they serve to define.
					The individual is effectively trapped between these conflicts; relieving one
					introduces greater burden from the other:
				</p>

				<img src="img/conflict.png" style="width: 100%">

				<p>
					Finally, people tend to reject "bad."
					This has a few meaningful parts.
					First, that people tend to improve, select, abstract.
					Second, it subverts the age-old question of Are-people-good-or-bad.
					Third, it helps to define learning, in a simplistic fashion.
				</p>

				<h2> Stability </h2>
				<p>
					Stability is the resistance to change about the beliefs of the intellect;
					effectively, then, instability determines the volatility of the simplifying
					process.
				</p>

				<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
				<p>
					One approach to generating a learning process would involve
					a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
					and optimizing (i.e., discarding sub optimal solutions).
				</p>

				<p>
					One approach to implementing the above might be
					to implement an optimizing function that sees
					the same thing in two distinct lights simultaneously.
					Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
					as a result of the same process.
				</p>

				<p>
					Another approach, perhaps more reasonable, might be to introduce a
					guess (so-called abductive reasoning), and entertain that (either
					until a contradiction is found, or indefinitely).
					In that case, an instance of abduction could be used as a method
					of internalizing an explanation.
					Then, abduction must be phrased in terms of simplification&mdash;
					it could be phrased formally as the average of the intellect's beliefs.

							<h2> Implementation of Intellect</h2>

							<p>
								A few characteristics of a possible implementation of intellect:
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>
										The abstracting process must be a process on the mind.
										That is, at each possible interaction, zero change is not possible.
										We stipulate this because without change, the abstracting process
										cannot be said to exist.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The abstracting process is <em>usually negative</em> in the sense
										that for the majority of interactions, the abstracting processes
										discards (marginalizes) the belief.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The elements have "memory," so
										that when they are suppressed, they tend to "bounce back."
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										It would be possible to "subconsciously" increase the importance of an
										element, so that it <em>is not</em> necessary to entertain a
										thought explicitly, in order to maintain it in thought.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The importance of an element is defined by its relation among other elements.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										The generation of a new node in this network is but a slight
										generalization of abductive reasoning.
										It would not need to be <em>true</em> with respect to anything
										except other nodes, in order to be considered important.
										A statement to this effect would be, "That is what I believed."
									</p>
								</li>
