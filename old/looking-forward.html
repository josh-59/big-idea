		<h2> Memory profile </h2>
		<p>
			In order to implement <em>intellect,</em> we will require a method
			of defining semi-discrete (overlapping) abstractions of finite order.
			One method of defining the order of an abstraction would be
			to define their duration implicitly,
			as a consequence of a particular memory or "remembrance"
			profile:

		<h2> Emotion </h2>
		<p>
				The "cost" of dereferencing abstractions;
				the "meaning" of belief.
				I think there's a connection between <em>belief</em> and <em>emotion</em> that,
				in part, guides the simplying process.
		</p>

		<h2> Thought </h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>  A <em>thought</em> is an ordered sequence of abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
		    Since an intellect fields an indefinite sequence of abstractions,
            a thought is a "slice" of an intellect.
			It might be useful, at some point, to divide thought into two classes:
			<em>Reasonable</em> thought being free of contradictions, and
			<em>unreasonable</em> thought containing contradiction.
		</p>

		<p>
			Reasonable thought has the important property that it may be abstracted
			away from.
		</p>

		<p>
			An unreasonable thought has the equally important property that it may
			not be abstracted away from.
			As a conjecture, 'ego' or 'self' is an unreasonable thought.
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> A process is conscious if it effects change upon itself.
			That is, a process which is a process on itself is conscious.
