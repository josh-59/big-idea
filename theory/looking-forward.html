		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<h2> Order </h2>
		<p>
			A singular process need not execute in isolation.
			Strictly speaking, we define order with respect to a realized process.
			Suppose $p$ is a process, and let $p(a)$ be a realization of that process.
			Then the <em>order</em> of $p(a)$ is the number of
			instances of $p$ extant in the argument of $p(a)$.
		</p>

		<center><img src="img/orders-broken-apart.png" style="width: 100%;"></img></center>

		<p>
			"extant in" was chosen because I'm choosing to focus my attention
			on the process of abstraction.



			This choice means that the "order" of any process is
			well-defined, without introducing "time."
		</p>

		<p>
			Of any given sequence of processes, the first will always be zero-order.
			In addition, a realized process in such a sequence
			will increase in order by at most one, relative to the previous process.
		</p>

		<p>


		<p>
			When speaking about sequences of realized processes that are stable with respect to order,
			we will characterize them by the order of their
			normative realized process.
			So,
		</p>

		<p>



		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
			Being clever <em>can increase</em> intelligence, but is not
			guaranteed to do so.
			This will be phrased formally as concurrence among processes.
		</p>

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One (inelegant) approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding suboptimal solutions).
		</p>

		<h2>Schizo</h2>
		<p>
			A more elegant approach to generating a learning process would
			be to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distict lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<h2>Intellect</h2>
		<p>
			My target object is the intellect, a self-conscious, learning
			process of order <i>n > 0</i> and depth <i>k > 3</i>, I believe.
			I think that the mind is, effectively, a data structure.
			Specifically, it is a data structure which is <i>active</i>,
			as opposed to <i>static</i>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moreover, I think that it is a data structure which operates in
			<i>O(0)</i> (Big-Oh-Zero) time; that is, it is infinitely
			economizing.
			As a conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			an "AI" as think of them).
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			A process which can enact change upon itself is conscious.
		</p>

		<h2> Meaning </h2>
		<p>
			Meaning strikes me as, "the difference it makes;" that is, significance
			is the change implied (by a given thing).  It might be sufficient
			to clause significance within a conditional.
			It isn't enough to be <em>convincing</em>; without consequence, a
			statement is meaningless.
			This "convincingness" is seen across domains: In the pursuit of
			mathematics for its own sake, when it is curious and "true," but
			without application.
		</p>

		<p>
			My point is, if a given statement or artifact makes no change, then
			it has no significance, has no meaning, and is not a process.
			As yet, this development of "meaning" is general, and without
			direction.
		</p>

		<h2> Sincerity </h2>
		<p>
			Concurrence among active processes; dependant upon "order."
			Both this and "meaning" are context-driven.
		</p>

		<h2> Context-Driven </h2>
		<p>
			A process is context-driven if the change it makes is
			dependant upon the context in which it is applied.
			For instance, the the successor function <em>is not</em>
			context-driven, for at each input, it simply adds one.
			On the other hand, the squaring function over the positive
			integers is context-driven.
		</p>

    <h2> Emotion </h2>
    <p>
        The "cost" of dereferencing abstractions;
        the "effect" of belief.
    </p>

		<h2> Belief </h2>
		<p>
				Beliefs are larger than I expected;
				abstractions are elementals, by comparison.
				I think that a <em>theory</em> is nothing
				more than a "formal" belief-- that they have the same form.
				In exactly the same way that a development traces a theory,
				I expect the intellect to trace beliefs as
				a "path of least resistance."
				All beliefs begin with assumptions.
		</p>

		<p>
				Beliefs guide the simplifying process, but do not determine it, per se.
				Obviously, we will require some mechanism for uniquely determining
				the simplifying process, but I cannot say honestly that I believe
				beliefs alone to constitute that mechanism.
				Whatever mechanism is developed must be smaller, more elemental,
				that beliefs.
		</p>

		<h2> Paradigm </h2>
		<p>
				A paradigm is larger yet than a belief; it might be understood
				as a collection of beliefs.
				This, I think, will be the formal interpretation of "ego."
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> It isn't my goal to implement, realize,
			or even define beliefs or paradigms, but only to understand them
			well enough to see <em>that</em> and <em>how</em> they could/might
			be realized through a particular implementation.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect </h2>
		<p>
				Conceptually, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
				In particular, we do not care about <em>the content</em> of thought, in
				the definition of intellect.
				We only concern ourselves with the pattern of abstractions that it generates.
				The abstracting process that an intellect fields at any given
				time is unique.
				That is, the intellect is deterministic.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect has been as a
			particular kind of data structure.
			Intuitively, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing,
			forever simplifying.
			Formally, it would be expressed as operation in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
			Continuing the conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			a "General Artificial Intelligence").
		</p>

		<h2> Memory profile </h2>
		<p>
			In order to implement <em>intellect,</em> we will require a method
			of defining semi-discrete (overlapping) abstractions.
			One method of doing so would be to define their overlap <em>implicitly,</em>
			as a consequence of a particular <em>memory</em> or <em>remembrance</em>
			profile:
		</p>

		<img src="img/mem-profile.png">

		<h2> Stability </h2>
		<p>
			The goal of this development is, intuitively, <em>to trap</em> a
			data structure and an algorithm into thinking.
			If we are successful, then <em>stability</em> will not
			be a matter of "failure."
		</p>

		<p>
			Nonetheless, stability will become an important consideration.
			Stability is the resistance to change about the beliefs of the intellect;
			effectively, then, instability determines the volatility of the simplifying
			process.
