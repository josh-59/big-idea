		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<h2> Memory profile </h2>
		<p>
			In order to implement <em>intellect,</em> we will require a method
			of defining semi-discrete (overlapping) abstractions of finite order.
			One method of defining the order of an abstraction would be
			to define their duration implicitly,
			as a consequence of a particular memory or "remembrance"
			profile:

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding sub optimal solutions).
		</p>

		<p>
			One approach to implementing the above might be
			to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distinct lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another approach, perhaps more reasonable, might be to introduce a
			guess (so-called abductive reasoning), and entertain that (either
			until a contradiction is found, or indefinitely).
			In that case, an instance of abduction could be used as a method
			of internalizing an explanation.
			Then, abduction must be phrased in terms of simplification&mdash;

		</p>

		<h2> Emotion </h2>
		<p>
				The "cost" of dereferencing abstractions;
				the "meaning" of belief.
				I think there's a connection between <em>belief</em> and <em>emotion</em> that,
				in part, guides the simplying process.
		</p>

		<h2> Stability </h2>
		<p>
			Stability is the resistance to change about the beliefs of the intellect;
			effectively, then, instability determines the volatility of the simplifying
			process.
		</p>

		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
			Being clever can increase intelligence, but is not
			guaranteed to do so.
		</p>

		<p>
			A problem with <em>being clever</em> is that, even if you are successful,
			you are projecting your current self into the future; you are
			denying yourself the ability to learn from the situation as it develops.
			This is fine in areas that do not change, such as mathematical calculations, chess, etc,
			but is not necessarily of practical value.
		</p>

		<h2>Conflict</h2>
		<p>
			A few thoughts on conflict:
		</p>

		<p>
			First, I think that conflict is the impetus for all
			action.
			The ideal conflict/resolution scenario is, I think, like scratching an itch:
			The conflict is minor, and its relief rewarding.
			On the other hand, a poor conflict/resolution scenario might be,
			scratching a scab:  Relieving the itch exacerbates the situation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Second, when there are multiple, coexisting and opposing conflicts, they serve to define.
			The individual is effectively trapped between these conflicts; relieving one
			introduces greater burden from the other:
		</p>

		<img src="img/conflict.png" style="width: 100%">

		<p>
			Finally, people tend to reject "bad."
			This has a few meaningful parts.
			First, that people tend to improve, select, abstract.
			Second, it subverts the age-old question of Are-people-good-or-bad.
			Third, it helps to define learning, in a simplistic fashion.
