		<h1> Looking Forward </h1>
		<hr>

		<h2> Order </h2>
		<p>
			A singular process need not execute in isolation.
			Strictly speaking, we define order with respect to a realized process.
			The <em>order of a realized process</em> $p(a)$ is the number of
			realizations of $p$ extant in the argument of $p(a)$.
		</p>

		<center><img src="img/orders-broken-apart.png" style="width: 100%;"></img></center>


		<p>
			We will principally be concerned with abstracting processes that are stable
			with respect to order (which is most of them).
			The <em>order of a process $p$</em> is the order of $p$'s
			normative realized process:
		</p>

		<h2> Consciousness </h2>
		<p>
			A process which can effect change upon itself is conscious.
		</p>


		<h2> Intellect </h2>
		<p>
			An intellect is an abstracting process of order at least 1.
		</p>

		<p>
				Conceptually, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
				In particular, we do not care about <em>the content</em> of thought, in
				the definition of intellect.
		</p>

		<h2> Memory profile </h2>
		<p>
			In order to implement <em>intellect,</em> we will require a method
			of defining semi-discrete (overlapping) abstractions.
			One method of doing so would be to define their overlap <em>implicitly,</em>
			as a consequence of a particular <em>memory</em> or <em>remembrance</em>
			profile:
		</p>

		<img src="img/mem-profile.png">


		<h2> Belief </h2>
		<p>
				Beliefs are larger than I expected;
				abstractions are elementals, by comparison.
				I think that a <em>theory</em> is nothing
				more than a "formal" belief-- that they have the same form.
				In exactly the same way that a development traces a theory,
				I expect the intellect to trace beliefs as
				a "path of least implied pain."
				All beliefs begin with assumptions.
		</p>

		<p>
				Beliefs guide the simplifying process, but do not determine it, per se.
				Obviously, we will require some mechanism for uniquely determining
				the simplifying process, but I cannot say honestly that I believe
				beliefs alone to constitute that mechanism.
				Whatever mechanism is developed must be smaller, more elemental,
				that beliefs.
		</p>

		<h2> Paradigm </h2>
		<p>
				A paradigm is larger yet than a belief; it is the circular set
				of beliefs that an intellect traces, if any.
				This, I think, will be the formal interpretation of "ego."
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> It isn't my goal to implement, realize,
			or even define beliefs or paradigms, but only to understand them
			well enough to see <em>that</em> and <em>how</em> they could/might
			be realized through a particular implementation.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect has been as a
			particular kind of data structure.
			Intuitively, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing,
			forever simplifying.
			Formally, it would be expressed as operation in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
			Continuing the conjecture, I think that any data structure operating in
			<i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect (and thus be
			a "General Artificial Intelligence").
		</p>

		<h2>Clever</h2>
		<p>
			A concept distinct from, though related to, intelligence, a process is
			<i>clever</i> if it looks ahead.
			Being clever <em>can increase</em> intelligence, but is not
			guaranteed to do so.
			This will be phrased formally as concurrence among processes.
		</p>

		<h2>Creative and Optimizing</h2>
		<p>
			One approach to generating a learning process would involve
			a single process being alternatively creative (i.e., trying new things)
			and optimizing (i.e., discarding suboptimal solutions).
		</p>

		<p>
			One approach to implementing the above might be
			to implement an optimizing function that sees
			the same thing in two distict lights simultaneously.
			Thus, each "creative" and "optimizing" would occur
			as a result of the same process.
		</p>

		<h2> Emotion </h2>
		<p>
				The "cost" of dereferencing abstractions;
				the "effect" of belief.
				I think there's a connection between <em>belief</em> and <em>emotion</em> that,
				in part, guides the simplying process.
		</p>

		<h2> Meaning </h2>
		<p>
			Meaning strikes me as, "the difference it makes;" that is, significance
			is the change implied (by a given thing).  It might be sufficient
			to clause significance within a conditional.
			It isn't enough to be <em>convincing</em>; without consequence, a
			statement is meaningless.
			This "convincingness" is seen across domains: In the pursuit of
			mathematics for its own sake, when it is curious and "true," but
			without application.
		</p>

		<p>
			My point is, if a given statement or artifact makes no change, then
			it has no significance, has no meaning, and is not a process.
			As yet, this development of "meaning" is general, and without
			direction.
		</p>

		<h2> Context-Driven </h2>
		<p>
			A process is context-driven if the change it makes is
			dependant upon the context in which it is applied.
			For instance, the the successor function <em>is not</em>
			context-driven, for at each input, it simply adds one.
			On the other hand, the squaring function over the positive
			integers is context-driven.
		</p>



		<h2> Sincerity </h2>
		<p>
			Concurrence among active processes.
			Both this and "meaning" are context-driven.
		</p>

		<h2> Stability </h2>
		<p>
			Stability is the resistance to change about the beliefs of the intellect;
			effectively, then, instability determines the volatility of the simplifying
			process.
		</p>

		<h2> Abductive Reasoning </h2>
		<p>
			Abductive reasoning promises a neat foundation to the "other half" of this
			theory.  Developed by Peirce, it says, intuitively, that the generation
			of hypothesis to explain some known event is the only creative component
			in the mind (my interpretation).
