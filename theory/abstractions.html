		<h1>Abstractions</h1>

		<hr>
		<p>
			An abstraction is a simplification;
			abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
			Several fields provide good examples of abstractions, especially, the sciences.
		</p>

		<h2> Examples of Abstraction In Computer Science </h2>
		<p>
			In computer science, abstraction is extremely important, and is necessarily defined in concrete terms
			(in virtue of the bit).
			For instance, the bit itself is an abstraction: It is defined to have
			only one of two possible states, and these states may be implemented in
			a variety of ways.
			We discard the actual state of the physical device, and
			focus on its relevant state.
		</p>

		<p>
			Within programming, a common practice is to write subroutines that
			carry out some small task well.
			This allows the programmer to break up a complex task into a sequence of simpler ones.
			Intrinsic to this process is the abstraction away from these subroutines:
			They are each individually written, tested, and ensured to work.
			Then, they are abstracted away from by discarding the implementing details.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, I wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development&mdash; specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
		</p>

		<h2> Examples of Abstraction in the Physics </h2>
		<p>
			

		<h2> Example 3: Propositional Logic </h2>
		<p>
			As a mathematics student, I have studied propositional logic more than once.
			For me, it is an intellectual tool:  Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement:
			As a mathematician, I can view any statement <i>as a proposition</i>,
			and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic, where substantial and relevant theory exists.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 4: Logic: Inference as Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			In propositional logic, the transitive law of implication
			is a commonly developed rule.
			Loosely, it states that, given "A implies B", and
			"B implies C", we may conclude "A implies C."
		</p>

		<p>
			The above reasoning is an act of abstraction:
			We are discarding statement <i>B</i> in its entirity.
			Moreover, the rule itself is an abstraction from the
			development that fielded it.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Below are a few definitions of abstractions.

				<h3>1</h3>

					"... <i>abstraction</i>: A simplification of something much more complicated that is going on under the covers."

					"Abstraction hides detail."

				<h3>3</h3>
				<p>
					"An <b>abstraction</b> [sic] is a view or representation of an entity that includes only the most significant attributes."
				</p>

		<p>
			Keeping Joel Spolsky's observation in mind, I arrive at the axiom,
			<em>All abstractions discard.</em>
