			An abstraction discards information;

			Every abstraction acts like a mathematical function, with

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Below are a few collected definitions of abstractions.
		</p>
		<br>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>1</h3>

				<p>
					"... <i>abstraction</i>: A simplification of something much more complicated that is going on under the covers."
				</p>

				<h3>3</h3>
				<p>
					"An <b>abstraction</b> [sic] is a view or representation of an entity that includes only the most significant attributes."

			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			An <em>abstraction</em> is a discarding process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because abstractions exist in multiple contexts, we must differentiate
			them in a meaningful way.
			We will divide abstractions into two classes, <em>pure</em> and
			<em>impure.</em>
			Pure abstractions are simplifications of singular entities.
			They are the purview of formal sciences, and one
			does not conduct science without dealing in pure abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Impure abstractions are simplifications of more than one entity.
			While these are not very interesting formally speaking, for they
			are not predictable, they are the intuitive method of the mind.
		</p>

		<h2> Pure Abstractions </h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			A <em>pure abstraction</em> is an abstraction of a single entity.
		</p>

		<p>
			In physics, kinematics is introduced by first modeling an object as
			a point.
			This point representation of the object is a pure abstraction of the object.
		</p>

		<p>
			In computer science, the bit is a pure abstraction of underlying
			hardware.
			It is defined to have only one of two possible states, and these
			states may be implemented in a variety of ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			Mathematical objects are pure abstractions;
			mathematics considers the case when simplification
			from reality has already taken place.
		</p>

		<p>
			In each of the above examples, the abstraction yields a many-to-one
			relationship: Many objects can be modeled as points.
			Many pieces of hardware can be thought of as bits.
			This holds in the general case: Abstraction never adds information.
			Equivalently, every abstraction is more general
			than the thing it discards from.
		</p>

		<p>
			Pure abstractions are variously known as <em>objects,</em> as in logic;
			and, <em>models,</em> within physics.
			I have previously developed them as <em><a href="founding-logic-with-abstraction.html">distinct abstractions</a>.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			However, the purpose of the pure/impure distinction is to give us the
			language required to describe the mind well:
			I am not here concerned with furthering pure abstractions;
			that is the domain of logic.
			Rather, I seek to use the concept well (that is, in a metalanguage sense) to highlight something which is impure.
		</p>

			<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>An Abstraction</figcaption></center>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In order to abstract, we require some data or material
				to abstract from.
				As a consequence, our depiction will be composed of two parts:
				Observing and Discarding:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Properly speaking, <em>abstraction</em> is the process of
				discarding from observation.
				Because we will tend to view the abstraction as a function, we will use the
				word <em>argument</em> as a synonym for <em>observation.</em>
				On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to the right.
				On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/axes-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Axes of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Thus, in these depictions, abstractions exist only on the right.
				Moreover, they decrease in specificity (and increase in generality):
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/sequence-of-abstractions.png">
				<center><figcaption>Sequence of Abstractions</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Where abstraction $1$ is more specific than $2$, and $2$ is more specific than $3$,
				and so on.

	<div id="order-of-abstraction">
		<h2> Order of an Abstraction </h2>
		<p>
			An abstraction need not exist in isolation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> The <em>order</em> of an abstraction $a$ is
			the number of abstractions extant in the observation by $a$:
		</p>

		<center><img src="img/orders-broken-apart.png" style="width: 100%;"></img></center>
	</div> <!-- End 'div id="order-of-abstration"' -->

	<h2> Depth</h2>
	<p>
		An abstraction need not be as simple as a single observation.
		Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, observations:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<center><img src="img/deep-abstraction.png" style="width:100%;"></center>
	</figure>

	<p>
		This we will refer to as the <em>depth</em> of the intellect.
	</p>

	<div id="belief">
		<h2> Belief and Abstraction  </h2>
		<p>
			In common usage, the word "thought" has two distinct meanings.
			The first is found in the response to the question, "What are you thinking?"
			This equivalently asks things like, "Are you upset?", "Are you mad?",
			"Would you like to sit down?", etc..
			The second usage is found in, "There's a thought!", or, "What a great idea!"
		</p>

		<p>
			These are two different things, and we must separate them in order
			to talk about them clearly.
			We will use the word <em>beliefs</em> to speak of the first entity,
			and the words <em>thought</em> and <em>abstraction</em>
			to synonymously refer to the second entity.
		<p>

		</p>
			Pictorially, we have:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/belief-and-abstraction.png">
		</figure>

		<p>
			where thoughts $1$ and $2$ are the beliefs of thought $3$.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>belief</em> of an abstraction is an abstraction present in
			its argument.  The <em>beliefs</em> of an abstraction is the collection of all abstractions present
			in its argument.
