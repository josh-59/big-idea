			An abstraction discards information;
			intuitively, an abstraction is a simplification.
			Every abstraction acts like a mathematical function, with
			distinct input and output.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Below are a few collected definitions of abstractions.
		</p>
		<br>

		<center>
			<div class=box>
				<h3>1</h3>

				<p>
					"... <i>abstraction</i>: A simplification of something much more complicated that is going on under the covers."
				</p>

				<h3>2</h3>
				<p>
					"Abstraction hides detail."
				</p>

				</p>

			<div class=box>
				<h3>3</h3>
				<p>
					"An <b>abstraction</b> [sic] is a view or representation of an entity that includes only the most significant attributes."
				</p>

			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			An <em>abstraction</em> is a discarding process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Because abstractions exist in multiple contexts, we must differentiate
			them in a meaningful way.
			We will divide abstractions into two classes, <em>pure</em> and
			<em>impure.</em>
		</p>

		<h2> Pure Abstractions </h2>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			A <em>pure abstraction</em> is an abstraction of a single entity.
		</p>

		<p>
			In physics, kinematics is introduced by first modeling an object as
			a point.
			This point representation of the object is a pure abstraction of the object.
		</p>

		<p>
			In computer science, the bit is a pure abstraction of underlying
			hardware.
			It is defined to have only one of two possible states, and these
			states may be implemented in a variety of ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			In each of the above examples, the abstraction yields a many-to-one
			relationship: Many objects can be modeled as points, and
			many pieces of hardware can be thought of as bits.
			This holds in the general case: Abstraction never adds information.
			That is, every abstraction is more general
			than the thing it discards from.
		</p>

		<h2> Impure Abstractions </h2>

		<p>
			Although certainly important, pure abstractions are too clean and
			neat to describe the operation of the mind in the general case.
		</p>

			<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

			<p>
				Several relevant components of abstractions may be
				conveyed by viewing it as a 'hump' or 'string':

				<center><figcaption>Axes of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				In order to abstract, we require some data or material
				to abstract from.
				As a consequence, our depiction is composed of two parts:
				Observing and Discarding:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Properly speaking, <em>abstraction</em> is the process of
				discarding from observation.
				Because we will view the abstraction as a function, we will use the
				word <em>argument</em> as a synonym for <em>observation.</em>
				On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to the right.
				On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:
			</p>


			<p>
				Thus, in these depictions, abstractions exist only on the right.
				Moreover, they decrease in specificity (and increase in generality):

				<img src="img/sequence-of-abstractions.png">
				<center><figcaption>Sequence of Abstractions</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Where abstraction $1$ is more specific than $2$, and $2$ is more specific than $3$,
				and so on.

	<div id="order-of-abstraction">
		<h2> Order of an Abstraction </h2>
		<p>
			An abstraction need not exist in isolation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> The <em>order</em> of an abstraction $a$ is
			the number of abstractions extant in the observation by $a$:
		</p>

		<center><img src="img/orders-broken-apart.png" style="width: 100%;"></img></center>
	</div> <!-- End 'div id="order-of-abstration"' -->

	<h2> Depth</h2>
	<p>
		An abstraction need not be as simple as a single observation.
		Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, observations:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<center><img src="img/deep-abstraction.png" style="width:100%;"></center>
	</figure>

	<p>
		This we will refer to as the <em>depth</em> of the intellect.
	</p>

	<div id="belief">
		<h2> Belief and Abstraction  </h2>
		<p>
			In common usage, the word "thought" has two distinct meanings.
			The first is found in the response to the question, "What are you thinking?"
			This equivalently asks things like, "Are you upset?", "Are you mad?",
			"Would you like to sit down?", etc..
			The second usage is found in, "There's a thought!", or, "What a great idea!"
		</p>

		<p>
			These are two different things, and we must separate them in order
			to talk about them clearly.
			We will use the word <em>beliefs</em> to speak of the first entity,
			and the words <em>thought</em> and <em>abstraction</em>
			to synonymously refer to the second entity.
		<p>

		</p>
			Pictorially, we have:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/belief-and-abstraction.png">
		</figure>

		<p>
			where thoughts $1$ and $2$ are the beliefs of thought $3$.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>belief</em> of an abstraction is an abstraction present in
			its argument.  The <em>beliefs</em> of an abstraction is the collection of all abstractions present
			in its argument.
