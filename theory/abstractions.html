		<h1>Abstractions</h1>

		<hr>
		<p>
			An abstraction is a simplification;
			abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
			The existence of an abstraction implies the existence of an abstracting process,
			and the existence of some observable phenomenon.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 1: <i>f</i>&ensp;is a function </h2>
		<p>
			Often, the first description of a function that a student encounters is that it's like a machine:
			You plug in a number, turn the crank, and, since <i>f</i> &nbsp;is a function, a unique value pops out.
			This is an abstraction of functions:  It preserves the notion that a function acts on an argument and returns
			a unique value, while ignoring the symbolic baggage usually associated with a formal definition.
		</p>

		<p>
			The abstraction above is intended as a bridge:  It is intended to get the student working
			with functions with a so-far accurate description.
			Eventually, this description will be discarded, and
			the student will be expected to adopt a formal definition of the object.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several fields provide great numbers of good examples of abstractions.
			In my experience, the clearest ones are found in computer science, where
			abstraction is extremely important, and is necessarily defined in concrete terms
			(in virtue of the bit).
			In computing, detail is hidden to produce something that does the same thing, but appears simpler.
			An example of this is considering the Linux Kernel's some 20-million lines of
			code to be a single entity.
			I also wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development, specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 2: Imperative Programming Languages </h2>
		<p>
			The imperative programming style is characterized by writing functions
			to carry out tasks, thereby breaking up a complex task into a sequence
			of function calls that each carry out a simpler task.
			Intrinsic to this process is the abstraction away from these functions;
			they are written, tested, and then used to more easily create more sophisticated programs.
		</p>

		<p>
			For any given subroutine, we abstract away from the implementing code by creating and naming the function uniquely.
			With this function in hand, we simplify our dealings to an interface that carries out the task.
			Ignoring the implementing details hides the complexity of the whole.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 3: Propositional Logic </h2>
		<p>
			As a mathematics student, I have studied propositional logic more than once.
			For me, it is an intellectual tool:  Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement:
			As a mathematician, I can view any statement <i>as a proposition</i>,
			and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic, where substantial and relevant theory exists.
		</p>

		<h2> Example 4: Logic: Inference as Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			In propositional logic, the transitive law of implication
			is a commonly developed rule.
			Loosely, it states that, given "A implies B", and
			"B implies C", we may conclude "A implies C."
		</p>

		<p>
			The above reasoning is an act of abstraction:
			We are discarding statement <i>B</i> in its entirity.
			Moreover, the rule itself is an abstraction from the
			development that fielded it.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			I have yet to produce a satisfactory definition of the concept of <em>abstraction.</em>
			As yet, I view it intuitively as <em>discarding</em> (verb) and
			<em>simplification</em> (noun).
			Below are a few definitions that support this.

		<p>
			It is my belief that the entirety of the human mind can be
			specified through abstraction alone.
			Intuitively, this says that the human mind can be understood as a
			memory mechanism of arbitrary complexity.
