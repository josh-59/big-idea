		<h1>Abstractions</h1>

		<hr>
		<p>
			An abstraction is a simplification;
			abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
			A single abstraction acts like a mathematical function, with input and output.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the abstraction is nontrivial, then it has distinct inputs and outputs.
			If the abstraction is trivial, then no change has been made; this precludes
			such "operations" from investigation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Several fields provide good examples of abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Examples of Abstraction In Computer Science </h2>
		<p>
			In computer science, abstraction is extremely important, and is necessarily defined in concrete terms
			(in virtue of the bit).
			For instance, the bit itself is an abstraction: It is defined to have
			only one of two possible states, and these states may be implemented in
			a variety of ways.
			We discard the actual state of the physical device, and
			focus on its relevant state.
		</p>

		<p>
			Within programming, a common practice is to write subroutines that
			carry out some small task well.
			This allows the programmer to break up a complex task into a sequence of simpler ones.
			Intrinsic to this process is the abstraction away from these subroutines:
			They are each individually written, tested, and ensured to work.
			Then, they are abstracted away from by discarding the implementing details.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, I wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development&mdash; specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
		</p>

		<h2> Mathematics and Abstraction </h2>
		<p>
			Mathematical objects are entirely abstract.
			That is, mathematics considers the case when simplification
			from reality has already taken place.
			Objects within mathematics are well-defined abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Examples Within Logic </h2>
		<p>
			For a mathematics student such as myself, propositional logic
			is an intellectual tool.
			Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement:
			I can view any mathematical statement <em>as a proposition</em>,
			and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic,
			where substantial and relevant theory exists.
		</p>

		<p>
			An example of reasoning by abstraction:
			In propositional logic, the transitive law of implication
			states that, given the premises, "A implies B", and
			"B implies C", we may conclude "A implies C."
			This reasoning is an act of abstraction:
			We are discarding statement <i>B</i> in its entirity.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Below are a few collected definitions of abstractions.

			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			An <em>abstraction</em> is a discarding process.

			<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

			<figure>

				<center><figcaption>An Abstraction</figcaption></center>
			</figure>
			<p>
				In order to abstract, we require some data or material
				to abstract from.
				As a consequence, our depiction will be composed of two parts:
				Observing and Discarding:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Properly speaking, <em>abstraction</em> is the process of
				discarding from observation.
				Because we will tend to view the abstraction as a function, we will use the
				word <em>argument</em> as a synonym for <em>observation.</em>
				On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to the right.
				On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/axes-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Axes of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Thus, in these depictions, abstractions exist only on the right.
				Moreover, they decrease in specificity (and increase in generality):
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/sequence-of-abstractions.png">
				<center><figcaption>Sequence of Abstractions</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Where abstraction $1$ is more specific than $2$, and $2$ is more specific than $3$,
				and so on.

	<div id="order-of-abstraction">
		<h2> Order of an Abstraction </h2>
		<p>
			An abstraction need not exist in isolation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> The <em>order</em> of an abstraction $a$ is
			the number of abstractions extant in the observation by $a$:
		</p>

		<center><img src="img/orders-broken-apart.png" style="width: 100%;"></img></center>
	</div> <!-- End 'div id="order-of-abstration"' -->

	<h2> Depth</h2>
	<p>
		An abstraction need not be as simple as a single observation.
		Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, observations:
	</p>

	<figure>
		<center><img src="img/deep-abstraction.png" style="width:100%;"></center>
	</figure>

	<p>
		This we will refer to as the <em>depth</em> of the intellect.
	</p>

	<div id="belief">
		<h2> Belief and Abstraction  </h2>
		<p>
			In common usage, the word "thought" has two distinct meanings.
			The first is found in the response to the question, "What are you thinking?"
			This equivalently asks things like, "Are you upset?", "Are you mad?",
			"Would you like to sit down?", etc..
			The second usage is found in, "There's a thought!", or, "What a great idea!"
		</p>

		<p>
			These are two different things, and we must separate them in order
			to talk about them clearly.
			We will use the word <em>beliefs</em> to speak of the first entity,
			and the words <em>thought</em> and <em>abstraction</em>
			to synonymously refer to the second entity.
		<p>

		</p>
			Pictorially, we have:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/belief-and-abstraction.png">
		</figure>

		<p>
			where thoughts $1$ and $2$ are the beliefs of thought $3$.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>belief</em> of an abstraction is an abstraction present in
			its argument.  The <em>beliefs</em> of an abstraction is the collection of all abstractions present
			in its argument.
