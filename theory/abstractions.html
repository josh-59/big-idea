		<h1>Abstractions</h1>

		<hr>
		<p>
			An abstraction is a simplification;
			abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
			Several fields provide good examples of abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Examples of Abstraction In Computer Science </h2>
		<p>
			In computer science, abstraction is extremely important, and is necessarily defined in concrete terms
			(in virtue of the bit).
			For instance, the bit itself is an abstraction: It is defined to have
			only one of two possible states, and these states may be implemented in
			a variety of ways.
			We discard the actual state of the physical device, and
			focus on its relevant state.
		</p>

		<p>
			Within programming, a common practice is to write subroutines that
			carry out some small task well.
			This allows the programmer to break up a complex task into a sequence of simpler ones.
			Intrinsic to this process is the abstraction away from these subroutines:
			They are each individually written, tested, and ensured to work.
			Then, they are abstracted away from by discarding the implementing details.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, I wish to say that computer science provided the genesis of this entire development&mdash; specifically,
			<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/"> Joel Spolsky's <i>The Law of Leaky Abstractions</i></a>.
			To express my appreciation, and for a clear example of an abstraction, I ask that you read his essay.
		</p>

		<h2> Mathematics and Abstraction </h2>
		<p>
			Mathematical objects are entirely abstract.
			That is, mathematics considers the case when simplification
			from reality has already taken place.
			Objects within mathematics are well-defined abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Examples Withing Logic </h2>
		<p>
			For a mathematics student such as myself, propositional logic
			is an intellectual tool.
			Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement:
			I can view any mathematical statement <em>as a proposition</em>,
			and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic,
			where substantial and relevant theory exists.
		</p>

		<p>
			An example of reasoning by abstraction:
			In propositional logic, the transitive law of implication
			states that, given the premises, "A implies B", and
			"B implies C", we may conclude "A implies C."
			This reasoning is an act of abstraction:
			We are discarding statement <i>B</i> in its entirity.
		</p>

		<h2>Definition of Abstraction</h2>
		<p>
			Below are a few definitions of abstractions.

			Keeping Joel Spolsky's observation in mind, I arrive at the axiom,
			<em>All abstractions discard.</em>

		<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

		</figure>
		<p>
			In order to abstract, we require some data or material
			to abstract from.
			As a consequence, our depiction will be composed of two parts:
			Observing and Discarding:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
			<center><figcaption>Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Properly speaking, an <em>abstraction</em> is the result of
			discarding from observation.
			On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to the right.
			On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/axes-of-abstraction.png">
			<center><figcaption>Axes of Abstraction</figcation></center>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Thus, in these depictions, abstractions exist only on the right.
			Moreover, they decrease in specificity (and increase in generality):
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/sequence-of-abstractions.png">
			<center><figcaption>Sequence of Abstractions</figcation></center>
		</figure>

		<p>
			Where abstraction $1$ is more specific than $2$, and $2$ is more specific than $3$,
			and so on.
		</p>

		<!--
		<p>
			These depictions are concerned with the general case, where the
			process of discarding is continuous.
			We could simplify this, but only
