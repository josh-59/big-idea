		    Abstraction is the act of discarding information.
            Intuitively, abstraction is simplification.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			An <em>abstraction</em> is any realization of a discarding process.
		</p>

        <p>
            Because it is our goal to describe the mind, we must describe the
            "muddled" thinking mentioned above.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            A <em>pure abstraction</em> is an abstraction of exactly one thing.
            An <em>impure abstraction</em> is an abstraction of at least two things.

			<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

			<p>
				Several relevant components of abstractions may be
				conveyed by viewing it as a 'hump' or 'string':

				On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to 
                the right.
                On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:

            <p>
                While we require some data to abstract from, the accumulation
                of data is not our primary interest.
                Rather, only the discarding of data concerns us.
                Nonetheless, our depiction may be intuitively understood
                as being composed of two parts, observation and discarding:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Intuitive Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
			    We choose to view the abstraction as a function, for it
                <em>is not</em> the data which is our primary interest;
                rather, our primary interest is the process of discarding it.
                Concurrently, we will use the word "argument" as a synonym for 
                "observation," and "result" as a synonym for "discarding."
                The instance of the function which yielded the change is 
                our abstraction proper.
            </p>

            <p>
                Often, a given abstraction will be composed of several smaller
                abstractions.
                In view of our depiction, then, it will be useful to orient
                ourselves with respect to this situation.

			An abstraction need not exist in isolation.

	<h2> Depth</h2>
	<p>
		An abstraction need not be as simple as a single observation.
		Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, observations:
