		    Abstraction is the act of discarding information.
            Intuitively, abstraction is simplification.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			An <em>abstraction</em> is any realization of a discarding process.

			<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

			<p>
			    
				Several relevant components of abstractions may be
				conveyed by viewing it as a 'hump' or 'string':

				On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to 
                the right.
                On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:

            <p>
                While we require some data to abstract from, the accumulation
                of data is not our primary interest.
                Rather, only the discarding of data concerns us.
                Nonetheless, our depiction may be intuitively understood
                as being composed of two parts, observation and discarding:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Intuitive Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
			    We choose to view the abstraction as a function, for it
                <em>is not</em> the data which is our primary interest;
                rather, our primary interest is the process of discarding it.
                Concurrently, we will use the word "argument" as a synonym for 
                "observation," and "result" as a synonym for "discarding."
                The instance of the function which yielded the change is 
                our abstraction proper.
            </p>

            <p>
                Often, a given abstraction will be composed of several smaller
                abstractions.
                In view of our depiction, then, it will be useful to orient
                ourselves with respect to this situation.

		<h2> Order of an Abstraction </h2>
		<p>
			An abstraction need not exist in isolation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> The <em>order</em> of an abstraction $a$ is
			the number of abstractions extant in the observation by $a$:

	<h2> Depth</h2>
	<p>
		An abstraction need not be as simple as a single observation.
		Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, observations:

		This we will refer to as the <em>depth</em> of the intellect.

		<h2> Belief and Abstraction  </h2>
		<p>
			In common usage, the word "thought" has two distinct meanings.
			The first is found in the response to the question, "What are you thinking?"
			This equivalently asks things like, "Are you upset?", "Are you mad?",
			"Would you like to sit down?", etc..
			The second usage is found in, "There's a thought!", or, "What a great idea!"
		</p>

		<p>
			These are two different things, and we must separate them in order
			to talk about them clearly.
			We will use the word <em>beliefs</em> to speak of the first entity,
			and the words <em>thought</em> and <em>abstraction</em>
			to synonymously refer to the second entity.
		<p>

		</p>
			Pictorially, we have:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<img src="img/belief-and-abstraction.png">

		<p>
			where thoughts $1$ and $2$ are the beliefs of thought $3$.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>belief</em> of an abstraction is an abstraction present in
			its argument.  The <em>beliefs</em> of an abstraction is the collection of all abstractions present
			in its argument.
