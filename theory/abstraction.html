		</div>

		<p>
			Abstractions form the heart and soul of this theory.
			Through them, the objects of the mind and the
            activity of thinking may be related in a fundamental way.
		</p>

		<p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            An <em>abstraction</em> is an ordered pair of two collections of
            information, $(a,b)$ such that $b$ is a proper subset of $a$.  
		</p>

        <p>
            For example, while "red" may be an abstraction from "truck", 
            "truck" cannot be an abstraction from "red".
        </p>

        <p>
            As a data type, an abstraction is a collection of data
            with structure:  It contains two distinct collections of
            data, $a$ and $b$, with the property that $b$ is found in $a$.
            More, they are not layered. 
            That is, heirarchies are a derived type.
        </p>

	    <p>
		    The two fundamental operations of abstractions are to
            <em>observe</em> it and to <em>apply</em> it.
            To observe an abstraction is to observe a thought; and,
            to apply an abstraction is to think.
            In either case, we obtain a collection of information.
		</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            An <em>abstracting function</em> is a collection of abstractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            An abstracting function need not be one-to-one.  
        </p>

	    <p>
            In order to make this development sound, an
            entity complimentary to <em>abstraction</em> must be introduced.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            An <em>observation</em> is a mapping from some (possibly empty)
            collection of information to a proper superset of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            An <em>idea</em> is a collection of information that is not
            an ordered pair.  In particular, a 
            collection of abstractions $A$ such that $|A| &gt; 1$ 
            is not an ordered pair.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may obtain an idea from an abstraction by supposing its
            argument and applying the abstraction.
            Alternatively, we may define an abstraction $i$ which maps
            an abstraction to an idea:
            $$i = ((a,b), b)$$
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            An <em>oversimplification</em> is an abstraction which discards
            the most relevant, pertinent or important information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Oversimplification will not be very useful in this
            theory formally, but will be valuable with respect to 
            talking about it, and so belongs "alongside" the material.
