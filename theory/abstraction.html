		<h1>Abstraction</h1>

		<div class="quote_text"> "Our everyday use of language is vague, 
            <br>and our everyday level of thinking is often muddled." </div>

		<p>
			In my opinion, abstractions are fundamental to the mind:
			Through abstraction, the <em>objects</em> of the mind and the
            <em>activity</em> of thinking may be related in a fundamental way.
            Let's look at these each, in turn.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first way to view an abstraction as an idea, its noun form. 
			In this form, an abstraction is an idea with the property that it is 
			a simplification of some other idea.
			This formalizes nicely:  If $X$ is some collection of information,
			and $Y$ is a proper subset of $X$, then $Y$ is an abstraction of $X$.
		</p>

		<p>
		    The second way to view an abstraction is as an act, and to 
            formalize the verb form of the word.
            This also formalizes nicely:
			An abstraction is a mapping from some information to less information.
		</p>

		<p>
            Which definition is more appropriate is situation-dependant:
            When one is carrying out abstraction, the second defintion is
            more appropriate;
            when one is observing the result of the act, the first definition
            is more appropriate.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, if we define abstraction to be a mapping from some
            information to less information, we get the second definition
            for free: since the 'mapping' will be an ordered pair.  
        </p>
           
        <p>
            PICTURE HERE
        </p>

        <p>
            Owing to the nature of our pursuit, we require both definitions,
            and so we will associate the word <em>simplification</em>
            with one of them:
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            A <em>simplification</em> is a collection of information with
            the property that it is a subset of some other collection of
            information.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            An <em>abstraction</em> is a mapping from some 
            information to less information.
        </p>

        <div class="notes">
            <p>
                Notes: 
                <ol>
                    <li>While <em>simplification</em> may be intuitively synonymous
                    with "abstraction", they will not be considered formally synonymous.</li>
                    <li>We associate "abstraction" with mapping, since we will be 
                    principally interested in abstraction as a process.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

		<h3> Observation and Abstraction </h3>

		<p>
			Observing and abstracting is a strategy for using the mind's memory;
			this strategy will emerge a few times in different contexts, but for now,
			it will be sufficient to explain only the lowest-level use that it is put to&mdash;
			namely, querying memory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here we have a data vs. time plot expressing the idea: 
		</p>

		<img src="./img/observation-abstraction.png">

		<p>
			To query memory intelligently, the mind could first observe,
			and then cease observing. 
			That part of the observation which does not change,
			or changes the least, is more well-known:  It is <em>remembered</em>.
			That part of the observation which <em>does</em> change is less well-known:  It
			is new.  
		</p>

		<p>
			The converse of this activity is "zoning out." 
		</p>

		<h2>Working Memory</h2>

		<p>
			If we assume that the mind has "working memory," and that its
			quantity is near (though not absolutely) constant, 
			then we arrive at the conclusion that these observation/abstraction
			pairs overlap:
		</p>

		<img src="./img/sequence-of-abstractions-on-data-vs-time.png">

        <p>
            Because it is our goal to describe the mind, we must describe the
            "muddled" thinking mentioned above.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            A <em>pure abstraction</em> is an abstraction of exactly one thing.
            An <em>impure abstraction</em> is an abstraction of at least two things.
        </p>

			<h2> Depicting Abstraction </h2>

			<p>
				Several relevant components of abstractions may be
				conveyed by viewing it as a 'hump' or 'string':

				On the horizontal axis is time, with "forward" existing to 
                the right.
                On the vertical axis is data, with "more" existing to the top:

            <p>
                While we require some data to abstract from, the accumulation
                of data is not our primary interest.
                Rather, only the discarding of data concerns us.
                Nonetheless, our depiction may be intuitively understood
                as being composed of two parts, observation and discarding:
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="img/parts-of-abstraction.png">
				<center><figcaption>Intuitive Parts of Abstraction</figcation></center>
			</figure>

			<p>
			    We choose to view the abstraction as a function, for it
                <em>is not</em> the data which is our primary interest;
                rather, our primary interest is the process of discarding it.
                Concurrently, we will use the word "argument" as a synonym for 
                "observation," and "result" as a synonym for "discarding."
                The instance of the function which yielded the change is 
                our abstraction proper.
            </p>

            <p>
                Often, a given abstraction will be composed of several smaller
                abstractions.
                In view of our depiction, then, it will be useful to orient
                ourselves with respect to this situation.

	<h2> Depth</h2>
	<p>
		An abstraction need not be as simple as a single observation.
		Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, observations:
