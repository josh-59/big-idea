		<h1> Intelligence </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			A process is learning if its execution alone implies an increase in
			efficiency.
			A process is intelligent if it is learning.
		</p>

		<h3>Efficiency</h3>
		<p>
			A process is learning if it gets better at what it does.
			This is sufficiently broad to capture the common intuitive notion
			of learning; our task is to consider and describe this formally.
		</p>

		<p>
			Already, we have enough formal theory to make nontrivial statements
			about the differences in intellects around us.
			For instance, a common housecat is <i>learning</i>, but is
			noncongnizant.
			It does not plan to learn; it does not study; it does not study
			its study.
