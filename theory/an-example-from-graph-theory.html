    <h1> An Example from Graph Theory </h1>

      The following passage is from John V Guttag's <i>Intoduction to Computation and Programming Using Python, second edition</i>, reprinted courtesy of the MIT Press:

        "Graphs are typically used to represent situations in which there are interesting relations among the parts.  The first documented use of graphs in mathematics was in 1735 when the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler used what has come to be known as <b>graph theory</b> to formulate and solve the <b>K&ouml;nigsberg bridges problem.</b>
    	</p>

  		<p>
        K&ouml;onigsberg, then the capital of East Prussia, was built at the intersection of two rivers that contained a number of islands.  The islands were connected to each other and to the mainland by seven bridges, as shown on the map on the left side of Figure 12.6.  For some reason, the residents of the city were obsessed with the question of whether it was possible to take a walk that crossed each bridge exactly once.

        Euler's great insight was that the problem could be vastly simplified by viewing each separate landmass as a point (think "node") and each bridge as a line (think "edge") connecting two of these points.  The map of the town could then be represented by the graph to the right of the map in Figure 12.6.  Euler then reasoned that if a walk were to traverse each edge exactly once, it must be the case that each node in the middle of the walk (i.e., any island that is both entered and exited during the walk) must be connected by an even number of edges.  Since none of the nodes in the graph has an even number of edges, Euler concluded that it is impossible to traverse each bridge exactly once."
