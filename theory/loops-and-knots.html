		<h1> Loops and Knots </h1>
		<hr>

        <p>
            A string may form a repeating structure, which
            we will refer to as a <em>loop</em>; when that loop also 
            contains a self-referential abstraction, we will refer
            to the structure as a <em>knot.</em>
            In the mind, the structure of a knot corresponds to ego.
        </p>

        <p>
            With respect to the mind's intellect, the loop structure
            is not very useful. While it is certainly possible that a
            mind could form a loop without self-referentiality, such a 
            structure would be implicitly dumb.
        </p>

        <p>
            The knot structure is fundamentally different because it
            contains a thread which refers to the entirety of the structure.
            It is very useful because introspection,
            and consequently intelligence, may be thought of
            as a tightening of the knot.
            This tightening does several things, not the least of which
            is freeing up memory for reuse.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>loop</em> is a string
            $$t_1, t_2, t_3, ..., t_n, t_{n+1}$$
            such that $n\in\mathbb{Z}$ and $t_1 = t_{n+1}$.
            The length of the loop is $n$, the number of distinct elements in it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>knot</em> is a loop
            that contains a self-referential thread, $t_I$.
        </p>

        <p>
            To illustrate the idea of a knot, we will next
            consider the simplest possible state of the conscious mind.
        </p>

        <h2>Example: I am</h2>

        <p>
            The presumptions are this: That the mind has memory,
            there exists an observing process within it, and
            the mind has no other memory (i.e., it has never seen, heard, 
            touched, smelled or tasted anything).
            This describes a mind "running" in a vacuum, without even emotion.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, the consciousness observes nothing.  
            However, the consciouness continues to write, and therefore
            must eventually observe the product of itself 
            observing nothing; whence, it concludes, "I".
            Observing this conclusion, it concludes "am".
        </p>

        <p>
            From these two observations, it concludes the simpler expression,
            "I".  
            From this, it simplifies to "am."
            And so on, and so forth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like all knots, this one includes a self-referential "I" statement.
            This knot has no sub-structure; the only thing "below" it is
            hardwired consciousness.
            Finally, it is "simplest" in virtue of its entertainment of
            two alternating abstractions (beliefs).
        </p>

        <p>
            The above structure is a knot with a string length of two, and is
            first-order.
            Next, we will generalize these notions.
        </p>

        <h2>Relationship of Length and Order of Knots</h2>

        <p>
            Let $k$ be a knot of length $n$.  
            Then the order of any thread in $k$ is not greater than $n-1$.
            Moreover, the order of $t_I$ is precisely $n-1$.
