		<a href="introduction.html"> Introduction </a> &ensp;
		We begin our investigation of the mind with the assumption that
		the mind is a component of the human body, where the body is
		separate from the world.

	<h2> Formal </h2>

	<p>
		<a href="abstractions.html"> Abstractions </a> &ensp;
		An abstraction is a simplification;
		abstracting discards information in order to produce something simpler.
		The existence of an abstraction implies the existence of an abstracting process.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="processes.html"> The Process </a> &ensp;
		This paper introduces the process, a function without fixed points.
		All processes make change;
		a process is a set of changes.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="process-of-abstraction.html"> The Process of Abstraction</a> &ensp;
		The simplest possible process: Discarding.
	</p>

	<!--
	<p>
		<a href="more-about-abstractions.html"> More About Abstractions </a> &ensp;
		Abstractions, discussed in the context of processes and neural nets.

	<p>
		<a href="economy.html"> Economy </a> &ensp;
		This paper introduces the notion of the economy of a process,
		how efficiently it carries out its change.
		Economy will form our formal foundation for
		intelligence.

		<a href="bridges.html"> Bridges </a> &ensp;
		Languages are funny things:
		They exist in their own right, and yet
		they exist to facilitate something else.
		When do you have <em>enough</em> of a bridge?

	<p>
		<a href="a_more_formal_view_of_thinking.html">A More Formal View of Thinking </a> &ensp;
		Here, we take another look at thinking.
		The idea that thinking is a process is introduced.

	<a href="tracing_objects.html"> Processes Tracing Objects </a> &ensp;
		Some demonstrations of the way that a process can be used to "create" an object are presented.

        This development takes time, and I thought I would post the parts of the theory which I look forward to.
