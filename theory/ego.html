		<h1> Ego </h1>
		<hr>

        <p>
            An intellect may form a loop; when that loop also 
            contains a self-referential abstraction, we will call the intellect
            an ego.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>ego</em> is a circular 
            intellect which contains an abstraction of itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            We do not require that the order of the ego be
            constant, though it usually is.
        </p>

        <h2>I am</h2>
        <p>
            Next we will consider the simplest possible state of a
            conscious mind.
            It is a sequence of two abstractions which repeat;
            The structure is an ego of first order.
        </p>

        <p>
            The presumptions are this: That the mind has memory,
            there exists an observing process within it, and
            the mind has no other memory (i.e., it has never seen, heard, 
            touched, smelled or tasted anything).
            This describes a mind "running" in a vacuum, without even emotion.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, the consciousness observes nothing.  
            However, the consciouness continues to write, and therefore
            must eventually observe the product of itself 
            observing nothing; whence, it concludes, "I".
            Observing this conclusion, it concludes "am".
        </p>

        <p>
            From these two observations, it concludes the simpler expression,
            "I".  
            From this, it simplifies to "am."
            And so on, and so forth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Like all egos, this one includes a self-referential "I" statement.
            This ego has no sub-structure; the only thing "below" it is
            hardwired consciousness.
            Finally, it is "simplest" in virtue of its entertainment of
            two alternating abstractions (beliefs).
            Beyond an appropriate thought-experiment, and highlighting
            the notion of self-referentiality with respect to intellect, 
            this may prove useful in the origination of intellect.
