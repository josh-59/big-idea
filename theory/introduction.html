		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			We begin our investigation of the mind with the assumption that
			the mind is a component of the human body, where the body is
			separate from the world.
		</p>

		<img src="img/intellect-in-reality.png">

		<p>
			If the human body has five senses, and a brain which interprets these senses, then
			the above must be an accurate depiction of the overarching role of the mind.
			We will generalize away from "human beings," and instead
			refer to <em>actors.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			The singular operation that will be entertained throughout this
			development is abstraction; intuitively, an abstraction is a
			simplification.
			I believe that the mind fields a sequence of semi-discrete abstractions.
			It is this belief that motivates this entire development.
		</p>

		<p>
			Such a sequence will be called an <em>intellect,</em> and while
			it may provide a great deal of the definition of an intelligent
			actor's mind, I do not think that it will provide the entire definition.
		</p>

		<h2> Intelligence </h2>

		<p>
			I have yet to produce a satisfactory definition of <em>intelligence.</em>
			The two approaches I have considered are "coincidence" and "efficiency."
			It should be intuitively obvious that <em>coincidence</em> cannot
			be used in a satisfactory definition, but it might still be worthwhile
			to have a look.
		</p>

		<p>
			The best example of intelligent coincidence is gear-mesh.
			The meshing of gears seems a fine enough coincidence to imply
			its creation by an intelligent actor.
			However, there's no meaningful way to discern coincidence and intelligence
			when intelligence is defined in terms of coincidence.
			So, we abandon that approach.
		</p>

		<p>
			A more recent approach has been through the notion of efficiency:
			Given two actors carrying out comparable tasks, the more efficient
			of the two may be said to be the more intelligent of the two.
			That is, <em>Greater efficiency implies greater intelligence.</em>
			Let's take an example.
		</p>

		<p>
			Suppose that two people are tasked with the same job: To cut down a tree.
			The first is equipped with an axe; the second, a chainsaw.

		</p>

		<p>
			Greater intelligence does not imply greater efficiency.
			Rather, <em>Greater intelligence implies a greater pursuit of efficiency.</em>
		</p>
