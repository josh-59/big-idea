            We begin by defining the mind is the part of the body that accepts 
            input and yields output:

        <p>
            Our principle object of development is the <em>intellect:</em>
            That part of the mind which carries out explicit thinking.
            This definition will allow us to place bounds on our development of the
            intellect.
            In particular, long-term memory will be viewed as a feature of the mind, 
            operating in tandem with the mind's intellect.
            Further, emotions will emerge implicitly, as a consequence
            of the intellect's thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
            We will be severely restricting the faculties which are
            available to us by considering only memory, and, the activity of writing
            to it, here referred to as <em>consciousness.</em>
		</p>

        <p>
            Necessarily, we must define <em>thought;</em> this is the subject of 
            the next chapter.
