		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			We begin our investigation by defining the mind to be
			part of the body:

        <p>
            Since we are restricting our attention to the mind's intellect,
            we must only consider two components of the mind: 
            Memory, and Consciousness.
			Within this theory, observation by the mind is writing 
            to the mind's memory. 
            The mind's consciousness is the 
            process responsible for this.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Axioms of the Mind's Memory</h2>

		<p>
			1) The mind is constantly forgetting.
		</p>

		<p>
			This statement could be realized indirectly by continual over-writing of a fixed quantity of memory.
		</p>

        <p>
			2) The essence of pain is that it is difficult to forget.
		</p>

		<p>
			The pain associated with any particular memory will be a single-dimensional quantity,
			aversion, which describes fear-of the associated memory.
			As yet, this is the only datapoint associated with each memory.
		</p>

		<p>
			One reason to frame this discussion in the negative (via pain, rather than love, say) is that
			doing so mitigates the possibility that the mind would be drawn to itself.
