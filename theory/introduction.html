		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			We begin our investigation of the mind with the assumption that
			the mind is a component of the human body, where the body is
			separate from the world.
		</p>

		<img src="img/intellect-in-reality.png">

		<p>
			If the human body has five senses, and a brain which interprets these senses, then
			the above must be an accurate depiction of the overarching role of the mind.
			We will generalize away from "human beings," and instead
			refer to <em>actors.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			The singular operation that will be entertained throughout this
			development is abstraction; intuitively, an abstraction is a
			simplification.
			I believe that the mind fields a sequence of semi-discrete abstractions.
			It is this belief that motivates this entire development.
		</p>

		<p>
			Such a sequence will be called an <em>intellect,</em> and while
			it may provide a great deal of the definition of an intelligent
			actor's mind, I do not think that it will provide the entire definition.
