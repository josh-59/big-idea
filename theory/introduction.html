		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			We begin by defining the mind to be part of the body:
		</p>

		<img src="img/intellect-in-reality.png">

        <p>
            Since we are restricting our attention to the mind's intellect,
            we must only consider two components of the mind: 
            Memory, and Consciousness.
			Within this theory, observation by the mind is writing 
            to the mind's memory. 
            The mind's consciousness is the process responsible for this.
		</p>

        <p>
            It is worth stressing that our goal is to produce a <em>sufficient</em> 
            explanation of the mind, and not an idealistic one.
        </p>
		
		<h2>Axioms of the Mind's Memory</h2>

        <p>
            1) The mind can observe itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is the central tenant of memory:
            Without the ability to observe itself, memory may as well not exist.
            Since we have defined <em>observe</em> to mean 
            <em>write to memory</em>, it follows that to recall a memory
            is to rewrite it somewhere new.
        </p>

		<p>
			2) The mind is constantly forgetting.
		</p>

        <p>
            The nature of "forgetting" drives the majority of this development:
            In preserving relevant parts of an observation, the mind
            generates <em>abstractions.</em>
        </p>

        <p>
			3) The essence of pain is that it is difficult to forget.
		</p>

        <p>
            Fear drives the mind, and avoiding painful situations is
            sane and rational behavior.
			One reason to frame this discussion via pain, 
            rather than, for instance, love, is that doing so mitigates 
            the possibility that the mind would be drawn to itself.
		</p>

        <h2>A Model of the Mind's Memory</h2>
        <p>
            Our model of the mind's memory will be broken into two
            components: Long-term memory and short-term memory.
            Short-term memory is where the "work" (i.e., explicit thinking)
            of the mind takes place. 
            Here, consciousness writes to memory with the intent to 
            recall the work explicitly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Consciousness writes to long-term memory
            without the intent to recall explicitly.
            Long-term memory offers related information;
            this information is written to short-term memory.
        </p>

	    <p>
			The pain associated with any particular memory will be a 
            single-dimensional quantity,
			aversion, which describes fear-of the associated memory.
			As yet, this is the only datapoint associated with each memory.
