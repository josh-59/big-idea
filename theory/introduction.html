		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			We begin our investigation by defining the mind to be
			part of the body:

		<img src="img/intellect-in-reality.png">

		<p>
			The above depiction suggests that the mind modifies its own input;
			equivalently, the mind indirectly observes its own output.
		</p>

		<p>
			Finally, it will be useful to generalize away from "human beings," and instead
			refer to <em>actors.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			An <em>actor</em> is composed of a mind, facilities for input and facilities for output.
		</p>

		<h2> Intelligence </h2>

		<p>
			I have yet to produce a satisfactory definition of <em>intelligence.</em>
			The two approaches I have considered are "coincidence" and "efficiency."
			It should be intuitively obvious that <em>coincidence</em> cannot
			be used in a satisfactory definition, but it might still be worthwhile
			to have a look.
		</p>

		<p>
			The best example of intelligent coincidence is gear-mesh.
			The meshing of gears seems a fine enough coincidence to imply
			its creation by an intelligent actor.
			However, there's no meaningful way to discern coincidence and intelligence
			when intelligence is defined in terms of coincidence.
			So, we abandon that approach.
		</p>

		<p>
			A more recent approach has been through the notion of efficiency:
			Given two actors carrying out comparable tasks, the more efficient
			of the two may be said to be the more intelligent of the two.
			That is, <em>Greater efficiency implies greater intelligence.</em>
			Let's take an example.
		</p>

		<p>
			Suppose that two people are tasked with the same job: To cut down a tree.
			The first is equipped with an axe; the second, a chainsaw.

		</p>

		<p>
			Greater intelligence does not imply greater efficiency.
			Rather, <em>Greater intelligence implies a greater pursuit of efficiency.</em>
		</p>
