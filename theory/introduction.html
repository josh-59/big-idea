		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			We begin our investigation of the mind with the assumption that
			the mind is a component of the human body, where the body is
			separate from the world.
		</p>

		<img src="img/intellect-in-reality.png">

		<p>
			If the human body has five senses, and a brain which interprets these senses, then
			the above must be an accurate depiction of the overarching role of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			The singular operation that will be entertained throughout this
			development is simplification; formally, we will call
			this operation <em>abstraction.</em>
			A single abstraction acts like a mathematical function, with input and output.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the abstraction is nontrivial, then it has <em>distinct</em> inputs and outputs.
			If the abstraction is trivial, then no change has been made; this precludes
			such "operations" from investigation.
		</p>

		<p>
			As depicted above, we will assume that the mind exists between two connections,
			which are separated by something other than itself&mdash; above, that thing is called "reality."
			That is, a mind observes the results of its own output;
			equally, it indirectly interacts with its input.
		</p>

		<p>
			These observations serve to frame the rest of our inquiry.
			Ultimately, I hope to define the <em>intellect</em> as a sequence of
			semi-discrete abstractions, each of which
			implicitly changes the mind's abstracting process.
