		<h1> A More Formal View of Thinking  </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Here, we take another look at thinking.
			The idea that thinking is a process is introduced.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the polynomial function,
		</p>

		<div class="quote_text">
			f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>  - 4.
		</div>

		<p>
			Obviously, this is an ordinary mathematical function; however, computing its value at, say, <i>x = 3</i>, is a process.
			Specifically, it is a process over the set of all algebraic expressions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let <i>p</i> be the process of evaluating <i>f</i> at <i>3</i>.
			We break the evaluation of <i>f</i> into three distinct steps,
			and consider each state <i>i</i> before each process takes place and
			after each process takes place:
		</p>

		<div class="proc">
			p(0):<br><br>
			f(x) = x<sup>2</sup>  - 4;<br><br>
			x = 3
		</div>

		<p>
			The next step will be to replace the chosen value for the independant variable and discard the assignment, <i>x = 3</i>:
		</p>

		<div class="proc">
			p(1):<br><br>
			f(3) = 3<sup>2</sup> - 4
		</div>

		<p>
			Next, we begin following the rules of order of operation, and square first:
		</p>

		<div class="proc">
			p(2):<br><br>
			f(3) = 9 - 4
		</div>

		<p>
			Finally, we subtract four and obtain the desired result:
		</p>

		<div class="proc">
			p(3):<br><br>
			f(3) = 5
		</div>

		<p>
			At this point, evaluation has concluded, and the process has ended.
			Some notes from this example:
		</p>

		<p>
			First, the process of evaluating an arithmetic expression is implicitly broken down into constituent steps.
			In my opinion, we apply <i>the same</i> process (that is, <i>our</i> process) four distinct times, before we have completed the task.
			The overarching change, from <i>p(0)</i> to <i>p(3)</i> is the result of an abstract (or meta) process;
			we implement this process by applying a more feasible process four distinct times.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I picture it,

			<center> <img src="img/3Process.png" style="width: 100%"> </img> </center>
		</p>

		<p>
			Abstraction is present in many forms in this process.
			At every step, we focus on one part of the expression, and ignore other parts;
			this is an implicit form of abstraction.
			Replacing each expression with another which is simpler (i.e., replacing <i>3<sup>2</sup></i> with <i>9</i>)
			is another form.
			In <em>p(1)</em>, we discard the information that <i>x=3</i>: Because <em>x</em> is no longer present,
			this information is no longer relevant.
			Finally, after obtaining the result in <em>p(3)</em>, we abstract from
			the computation itself: <em>f(3) = 5</em> is all that we require.
			This is analogous to accepting the conclusion of an argument
			by discarding the reasoning that got us there.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now we look at the process more literally.
			All processes make change.
			After making their change, the result of a given process (a new and distinct state) remains unchanged
			for some length of time.
			This can be understood as a "resolved" state;
			a process-state with nonzero duration, the lowest-energy state that a process can be in.
			After the resolved state, a process ceases to exist.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, after obtaining the result, <i>f(3) = 5</i>, that result sticks around
			for some time, allowing the individual to use or reference it.
			This is true <i>for each step</i> of the process, as well: <i>p(1)</i> observes the result of <i>p(0)</i>;
			<i>p(2)</i> observes the result of <i>p(1)</i>, etc.
			Each of these "observations of the result of the previous process" are abstractions from the previous process.
		</p>

		<h2> Conclusion </h2>
		<p>
			I do not feel that I've taken any gratuitous leaps with this assessment; I feel that this is a
			clear portrayal of what's more or less expected of individuals as they learn elementary mathematics.
			It seems prudent to point out that I <i>am not</i> claiming that each state <i>p(i)</i> in the above process
			is a consequence of a single abstraction.
			Rather, I claim that the above process <em>can be implemented via abstraction alone</em>,
			by considering and casting it in different lights.
			We will require more theory to discuss this intelligently&ndash; in particular,
			processes.
