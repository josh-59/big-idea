            The essence of thought is
            to first introduce some arbitrary observation, then to "load up"
            relevant abstractions, to attempt these abstractions on the idea,
            and finally to evaluate the results, repeating as necessary.
        </p>

        <p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			A <em>ratiocination</em> is a finite sequence of observations and abstractions  
            $$(a_1, b_1), (a_2,b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n)$$

            such that $b_1 = a_2, b_2 = a_3, ...$, and 

            $(a_1, b_n)$ forms an abstraction.
		</p>

        <p>
            With this definition, our model should become intuitively clear:
            We are imagining a container of information is being operated on
            reiteratively.
            The two operations are to add information and to subtract information.
            Each operation $(a_x, b_x)$ is defined outside of the rationcination, 
            and is therefore effectively arbitrary with respect to it.
        </p>

            Depictions such as the one above will be common in what follows,
            and therefore it may be well to explain them precisely.
            On the y-axis is data, and on the x-axis is time.
            The horizontal line of the x-axis represents zero data.
            Each line plotted represents a distinct container of information;
            any point on the line represents the quantity of information
            it contains at that time.
            Dotted lines do not represent containers of information, and 
            they will be used only to illustrate relevant concepts.
            Finally, note that in the depiction above, the curve denoting 
            the ratiocination is composed strictly of abstractions, since the 
            quantity of information is monotonically decreasing.
        </p>
       
        <p>
            The curve representing <em>ratiocination</em> concaves downward
            owing to an assumption about the mind:
            That it continually forgets.
            (In virtue of this assumption, it may be possible to restate
            this theory, or to implement it, in terms of observation alone:
            Obervation reinforces some particular subset of the information,
            with the rest being implicitly discarded.)
        </p>

        <p>
            By way of ratiocination, the mind generates new abstractions for itself:
            A new operation is produced, which may be included in other
            ratiocinations.  
            Finally, note that obtaining this new abstraction 
            involves only observing the ratiocination's container of information 
            at two distinct points in time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thinking, then abstracting from it by forming an abstraction
            is the principle mechanism of the intellect.
            The resulting abstraction preserves the salient components of
            the ratiocination, and discards the work.
            It is not important that the resulting abstraction be correct;
            what's important is that it is the mind's own work, and therefore,
            there's no sense in redoing it, and therefore no sense in discarding it entirely.
            That is, it is the intellect's own role to learn to think.
        </p>

        <p>
            An important special case arises when the source of a 
            ratiocination is restricted to the intellect itself.
            In generating and adopting such an abstraction, the mind 
            simplifies itself.
            This is introspection in the narrowest sense of the word,
            and I believe it to be the genesis of intelligence.
        </p>

        <p>
            In order to realize the fruits of ratiocination, the mind 
            must adopt a particular, "semi-discrete" structure.
