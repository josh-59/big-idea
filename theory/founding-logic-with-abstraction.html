		<h1> Founding Logic with Abstraction </h1>
		<h2> Objects </h2>

		<p>
			We begin with objects, because they are fundamental to first-order logic.
			Intuitively, an object is a <em>thing</em> that we may talk about.
			We will define objects formally through abstractions.
			As noted in the essay on abstractions, an abstraction is a
			simplification.
			To bear out the notion of an <em>object,</em> we must introduce the idea of
			distinct abstractions.
			An example will help.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the symbols, $$p \text{ and } \rho.$$
			On the left we have an ordinary <em>p.</em>
			On the right we have the Greek letter <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho">rho</a>.</em>
			Neither a layman nor a casual reader would make a distinction between these
			two symbols: For them (and for all of us in most contexts), both symbols
			denote the English letter <em>p.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			In some contexts, however, the symbols are used to talk about two different things.
			In such a context, the reader must be more attentive to distinguish them
			(and the author must make their distinction suitably clear).
			In such a context, the symbols <em>are distinct.</em>
			Otherwise, they are not.
			That is, <em>If we make a distinction, then they are distinct.
			Otherwise, they are not.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			We can be wrong on either account.
			That is to say, we can err in reading by either
			making a distinction where one was not intended, or by failing
			to make a distinction where one was intended.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>object</em> is a distinct abstraction.
			Objects have the property that they are invariant under thought.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, a pen is an object, as is a book.
			A particular book, such as <em>Moby Dick,</em> is	an object, as well.
			Further, <em>my copy of Moby Dick,</em> is an object, too (assuming that
			I only own one copy).
		</p>

		<p>
			We make no distinction between objects that can be "realized by"
			some physical entity and those that cannot.
			Therefore, the color <em>blue</em> is an object just as much as <em>a bottle</em> is an object,
			for both are well-defined abstractions.
			In particular, imaginary entities, such as unicorns, are objects as well
			(this last is, to my knowledge, somewhat deviant with respect to contemporary developments
			of FOL).
		</p>

		<p>
			Objects transcend language;
			they belong to the mind alone.
			As long as it can be made distinct, we will say that it is an object.
		</p>

		<p>
			One last example:
			<em>The number two.</em>
			The number two is a particular quantity;
			it is not "realized by" any physical entity.
			Rather, it is the abstraction common to all pairs of objects.
			That is, the number two is a distinct abstraction, and is, to my mind,
			otherwise nonexistent.
		</p>

		<h2> Names </h2>
		<p>
			In a formal development, we want to consider each object
			individually and explicitly.
			In order to talk about an object, it is necessary to have a tangible reference
			to it.
			The tangible portion of such a reference  will be called
			an <em>expression.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>expression</em> is a distinct abstraction from something written.
		</p>

		<p>
			It could be a single symbol, a short word, or a lengthy description.
			Hence, $$x$$ is an expression, as is $$max,$$ as is $$\text{left of home plate.}$$
		</p>

		<p>
			When an expression refers to an object,
			it is called a <em>term</em>,
			and we will say that the term <em>denotes</em> the object.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>term</em> is a distinct abstraction that refers to another distinct abstraction.
		</p>

		<p>
			The situation can be likened to pointers in C:
		</p>

		<a href="img\pointer.png" title="Click for larger image"><img src="img/pointer.png"></a>

		<center><p style="font-size: small; width: 75%;"><em>
			In C, a </em>pointer<em> is a variable that hold the address of another
			variable.<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>
			Hence, if </em>p<em> is a pointer, and </em>x<em> and </em>y<em> are also variables,
			then we can arbitrarily assign to </em>p<em> the address of either </em>x<em> or </em>y<em> (or </em>p<em>), thereby giving ourselves a
			new, albeit indirect, handle to the memory implicitly referred to by </em>x<em> or </em>y<em> (or </em>p<em>).
		</em></p></center>

		<p>
			For example, the symbol $2$ commonly denotes a quantity;
			when used as such, it is a term.
			With the words on objects above in mind, we can say that 2 is the same term as <em>2</em>,
			for we make no distinction between the two expressions.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is an error in logic to denote two distinct objects with the same
			term simultaneously.
			We impose this restriction because we wish to speak about objects
			without ambiguity.
			English, being a natural language, does not follow this rule.
			This is one of the reasons to develop formal languages:
			Multiple-meanings is an avenue of ambiguity.
		</p>

		<p>
			This work is an independent development.  However, it is intended to
			loosely coincide with Patrick Suppes's <em>Introduction to Logic.</em>
			For further reading on names, see &#167;3.2, "Terms," and &#167;6.1, "Names and Things Named,"
			of <em>Introduction to Logic.</em>
		</p>

		<h2> Language: Meta vs. Subject </h2>
		<p>
			In making a clear distinction between expressions, terms and objects,
			we have begun to carve out the capability to generate languages for ourselves.
			Specifically, we can now assign any meaning we like to any symbol we like&mdash;
			that is, we can <em>define</em> expressions.
			Neither objects nor expressions belong to language; rather,
			interpretations of expressions (that is, definitions) belong to language.
		</p>

		<p>
			A new first-order language, as it is being developed, we will call the
			<em>subject language.</em> (It is often called the <em>object language</em>,
			as seen on page 11 of Suppes's <em>Axiomatic Set Theory,</em> but I do not
			wish to confuse the notions of "object" and "object language" in this
			development.)
			A language used to describe (develop) a subject language is called
			a <em>metalanguage.</em>
			We always assume familiarity with metalanguages.
		</p>

		<p>
			We often develop one subject languages in terms of other subject languages.
			In abstract algebra, for instance, the metalanguage involves set theory and the integers.
			Consider the statement, $$x^3=e.$$
			Here, the integer <em>3</em> is part of our metalanguage, and what we are
			using it to talk about is within the subject language of abstract algebra.
		</p>

		<p>
			The intuitive idea of metalanguages is found in many areas of science.
			For instance, engineers assume mathematics in the course of their work,
			and this means that mathematics is part of their metalanguage.
			Mathematicians, in turn, assume a familiarity with logic, and as a
			consequence, first-order logic is part of their metalanguage.
			Logicians, in turn, usually develop their subject as best they can
			in terms of some natural language.
		</p>

		<p>
			What these fields have in common is their logical rigor, which is
			always founded upon the notion of an "object."
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>individual constanst</em> is a term that has a unique definition
			throughout the entirety of a language.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once an individual constant is defined, it may be assumed that the symbol denotes that object
			throughout the entirety of the language it is defined within; in other words, the uniqueness
			of an individual constant's definition is only guaranteed within its language.
		</p>

		<h2> Making Statements </h2>
		<p>
				In order to make statements about objects, we will require appropriate
				formal tools to let us do so.
		</p>

		<p>
				<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>predicate</em> is an
				expression that makes a definitive statement about an object.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first predicate we will look at is the identity relation,
			denoted by the double-bar "equals sign."
			This predicate says that two names
			<em>denote the same</em> object:
		</p>

		$$
		a = b
		$$

		<p>
			The above says that $a$ refers to the same object as $b.$
		</p>

		<p>
			To give a concrete example, if we stipulate that the symbol $1$ denotes
			the set containing the empty set, then we arrive at the truism that,
		</p>

		<p>

		$$
		1 = \{\{\}\}
		$$

		</p>

		<p>
			A typical use of identity in mathematics is found in Walter Rudin's <em>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</em>.
			In the definition of an ordered set, we find:
		</p>

		<p> <em> Definition </em> Let $S$ be a set.  An <em>order</em> on $S$ is a relation, denoted by &lt;,
			with the following two properties:

			<ol>
				<li>
					If $x\in S$ and $y\in S$ then one and only one of the statements
					$$
					x < y, \hspace{2em} x = y, \hspace{2em} y < x
					$$
					is true.
				</li>
				<li>
					If $x, y, z \in S$, if $x < y$ and $y < z$, then $x < z$.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

		<p>
			I interpret the first property as stating that, given any two elements of an ordered set, either one is larger than the
			other, or they are the same element;
			the second property stipulates transitivity.
			It should be noted that I will develop this logic only as long as it
			remains true to such mathematical statements.
		</p>

		<p>
			Both objects and names are mainstays of first-order languages;
			concurrently, <em>identity</em> is often included in first-order languages, and is
			often studied within first-order logic.
			However, note that because identity is a predicate, it does not <em>necessarily</em> belong
			to a given first-order language.
			As a consequence, it does not belong to first-order <em>logic</em>, per se,
			though it is usually developed there (for it is so common).
			For more on the subject of identity, see &#167;5.1, "Logic of Identity," of <em>Introduction to Logic.</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			This discussion has begun our study of predicates,
			and it is here that I begin to diverge from first-order logic.
			I define: A <em>predicate</em> is an individual constant that denotes a relation among objects,
			some of which may be fixed.
		</p>

		<p>
			A few examples of predicates:
			<ol>
				<li> $=$ </li>
				<li> $<$ </li>
				<li> <em>Is_Brother_Of</em></li>
			</ol>
		</p>

        <h2> Development, Theory </h2>
				<p>
					A development is independent: It stands on its own.
				</p>

        <p>
            It is permissible to mix object and metalanguages, so long as doing so does not presuppose
            future material.
            A development uses the object language to further the object language.
        </p>

        <p>
            A development is a trace of a theory;
            is one of many possible traces of the same theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            A development is either founded on well-defined abstractions, or it is circular.
        </p>

        <p>
            One develops ideas in much the same way that one develops photographs.
        </p>

				<h2> Identity </h2>

				<p>
					The logic that we will be developing here is known as
					<em>First Order Predicate Logic with Identity.</em>
					The emphasis here is unambiguously on objects,
					in part because it is the author's opinion that objects are what both
					logic and math are fundamentally concerned with.
					In addition, it allows an early and rigorous development of identity.
				</p>

				<p>
					Identity is concerned with making explicit the situation in which two
					terms <em>denote the same object.</em>
					The symbol used to denote identity is the double-bar: $$=$$
					This symbol should be read, <em>"...denotes the same object as...."</em>
					It is often informally (and somewhat erroneously) read as <em>"...equals...;"</em>
					in more formal developments it is read as, <em>"...is identical with...."</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					This definition of the double-bar sign preserves its meaning from contemporary
					developments, and, in virtue of the definition of objects given above, makes
					explicit my interpretation of its meaning.
					See also:
					&#167;5.1, "Logic of Identity," in Suppes's <em>Introduction to Logic.</em>
				</p>

				<p>
					Namely, if $x$ denoted two distinct objects, then it would be true that,
					$$ x\neq x, $$ which is a logical absurdity, and one which we choose
					to disallow in our writing.
				</p>


		<h2> Sentential / Truth-Functional Connectives </h2>

		<p>
			<em>Introduction to Logic</em>, Page 43:
			"We are not committed to developing a logic adequate to all the nuances of
			everyday language."


					<p>
						This is done for well-devised reasons:
						<ol>
							<li>Given a declarative sentence, we can always determine its truthity</li>
							<li>By defining implication in terms of truth-values, we can make its meaning explicit</li>
						</ol>

						Indirection (notes):
							https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering

							An example of poor indirection:
							Definition 16, Graph Theory
							"Are said to be"
						</p>

						<p>
							Another thing one can say about objects, which the developments of
							logic given above do not touch upon, is that one object may be contained in
							another object.
							Tentatively, we will define this as the <em>is</em> relation.
							We define:
							For any two objects $a$ and $b$, "$a$ <em>is</em> $b$" is true if and only
							if $b$ is a correct abstraction of $a.$
						</p>

						<p>
							This is used in natural language to make statements like, "That bottle is blue."
							The abstraction denoted by "bottle" contains the abstraction "blue,"
							and "blue" is a correct abstraction of the bottle;
							we might say things like, "Hand me that blue thing over there."
						</p>

						<h2> Indirectly Defining Objects </h2>
						<p>
							In mathematics and all empirical sciences, it is customary to use
							explicit definitions wherever possible.
							This isn't always possible, especially at the roots of a development.
							Another way to describe the abstraction is implicitly;
							intuitively, we seek only to describe the object unambiguously.
						</p>

						<p>
							For a first example, consider the number $0$.
							At first glance, this number seems to pose a problem:  What could it be
							a simplification of?
							Formally, however, in any algebraic structure,
							$0$ is taken to be the additive identity of the structure, and is defined
							by a property it has:

							$$
							x + 0 = x
							$$

							for all $x$.
						</p>

						<p>
							This is an example of an implicit definition, because we have
							defined $0$ sufficiently and unambiguously by defining a property
							it is said to have.
							Similar remarks apply to negative numbers.
							Far from being a hole in this theory of abstraction, I feel that
							this helps explain what makes such entities intuitively troublesome:
							They <em>are not</em> abstractions from real, tangible things.
							They are as imaginary as the complex number $i$.
						</p>

						<h2>About</h2>

						<p>
							My other project, <a href="https://josh-59.github.io/Learning-Linux/">Learning Linux</a>,
							has been remarkably successful in teaching me about Linux.
							In addition, it's taught me to read works of all kinds, because the struggle in writing well
							about Linux has been in using language to express ideas, where the ideas are well-founded, and the language is variable.
							It seemed that a similar pattern was forming in the study of logic: That my own thoughts on logic
							exist, but are not sufficiently defined to be unambiguous, and therefore,
							progress in learning the subject has stalled.
						</p>

						<p>
							So, I endeavor to recapture the success of the Learning Linux project, in the study of logic.
							The two books I'm reading on logic are, <em>Language, Proof and Logic</em>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., by Dave Barker-Plumer,
							Jon Barwise & John Etchemendy; and
							<em>Introduction to Logic</em> by Patrick Suppes.
							I mention this because these, together, form the foundation of my studies about logic.
							<em>Language, Proof and Logic</em> is a contemporary work on the subject of logic; moreover,
							because it is the work of three authors, I feel that it represents well the subject as it
							is taught today.
							<em>Introduction to Logic</em> was written in 1957; although it is comparatively dated,
							Patrick Suppes is a remarkable author.
						</p>


						<h2> Indirection </h2>

						<p>
						    There are always two ways to approach an intellectual problem.
                            1) To add greater specificity to existing abstractions.
                            2) Introduce a new layer of indirection
						</p>

						Variables are defined separately.
					</p>

					<p>
						<strong>Definition:</strong> A <em>variable</em> is an expression that does not denote anything.
