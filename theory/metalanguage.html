		<h1>Metalanguage</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Initially inspired by words in
			Dr. Suppes's <em>Axiomatic Set Theory</em>, here I generalize the notion in order
			to provide a more formal, if still intuitive, description of learning:
			All learning can be expressed as adopting new metalanguage.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the aforementioned <em>Axiomatic Set Theory,</em> it is explicitly
			pointed out (page 11) that, "Our metalanguage is a certain vaguely defined
			fragment of ordinary English augmented by certain symbols familiar from intuitive
			mathematics."
			Within that work, this metalangauge is used to develop the "object language" of
			set theory.
		</p>

		<p>
			As yet, I have no desire to develop object languages, but I see great
			potential in the idea of metalangauge to help describe how the mind
			operates.
		</p>

		<p>
			Intuitively, a <em>metalanguage</em> is the language used in the course of some work.
			It is been adopted by the actor as native material; it is part of themselves.
			Moreover, the actor uses the metalanguage to attain some goal.
		</p>

		<p>
			As a first example, <em>LaTeX</em> is a metalanguage.  On the one hand,
			it must be learned (and is not the easiest program to learn).
			On the other, it exists for the sole purpose of typesetting documents.
			One <em>learns</em> LaTeX, and then goes about forgetting it as quickly
			as possible, in order to achieve their ultimate goal of publishing some paper.
		</p>

		<p>
			This first example is intended to illustrate the generality I seek in the
			development of "metalanguages."  Many other programs may be considered
			metalanguages:
		</p>

		<ul style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
			<li>Word</li>
			<li>Git</li>
			<li>CAD</li>
			<li>MATLAB</li>
			<li>Video production / Music Production Suites</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			An interesting thought-experiment:  A layman could probably pick up
			a LaTeX source document and work out what it says (given that all
			they are lacking is knowledge of LaTeX).
			On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to expect them to
			turn around and use the program to create documents of their own.
			That is, the metalanguage of LaTeX is spoken in the syntax and semantics of
			LaTeX source, and not in the English (or mathematical) content of the document.
		</p>

		<p>
			The next interesting example comes from science.
			It is colloquially said that, "Chemistry is Everywhere."
			I had never understood this expression until I phrased it in terms
			of metalanguages:  Chemistry is the formal language of materials,
			and it is spoken everywhere that materials are considered (which is everywhere).
			As an aside, I'm currently reading <a href="https://open.umn.edu/opentextbooks/textbooks/general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications">General Chemistry: Principles, Patterns and Applications</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Metalanguages are <em>subjects</em> which are well-defined, and
			which are internalized for their subsequent assumption, in the
			course of carrying out some arbitrary goal.
		</p>

		<p>
			A few more examples:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> A crime fiction's metalangauge is English; its purpose is to entertain</li>
			<li> Mechanics is the metalanguage of auto technicians etc</li>
			<li> Both music itself and instruments are metalanguages of the musician</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			For any metalanguage, we require some layer underneath it, in order to discuss it.
		    But, we do not need additional layers to use it.
