Filters:

    A <em>filter,/em> is an abstraction of the form
    (<delta>, <null>).

    For any abstraction (a,b), 
    <delta> = a - b, and 
    ((a,b),<delta>) is an abstraction.
    
    The <em>meaning</em> of abstractions and of intellect is to filter information,
    and ultimately, say "no."

    "No", in turn, is the genesis of individuality.
