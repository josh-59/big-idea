Introversion:
    The mind's tendency to observe itself
    Implies simplification of the intellect,
        and is the genesis of intelligence
    Controlled primarily by pain threshold:
        Very low pain threshold implies that the mind would find respite in itself
        And would generate more intelligent responses in an incidental manner

Emotions:
    Rather than assuming them to be an "undefined primitive," 
    in this development I expect them to be thoughts about oneself.

    For instance:
    Fear -> thought of losing oneself.
    Hate -> Desire/Proclivity to change
    Love -> Could never hate

Memory:
    A notable quality of memory is that one does not remember remembering.
    Doing so would generate new memories, rather than reinforcing old ones.
    As such, I expect this to be modeled (here) as a high-level-though-still-
    rudimentary pattern of thought.

Orders:
    Structure of a THOUGHT, _not_ an abstraction.

    Higher order -> Greater simplification
        (but threatens to oversimplify) 

    It is possible to oversimplify by discarding the structure of the
        abstraction. 
        This is the genesis of psychology, for instance. 

    Organization:
    The tendency of an intellect to become a container of information.
    "Coherency"

This-is-a-that:
    The first stage of organization: Definition-building
    (Intuitively named)

Intelligence:
    The efficacy with which an intellect resolves conflict
        -> Define Conflict
        -> Define Efficacy

Belief:
    """
    Definition:
    A belief is an abstraction present in the argument of an abstraction.
    """

Model:
    """
    A model is to thought what a mneumonic is to memory.

    Definition:
    A model is an abstraction which supports metathought
    """

Precise Thinking:
    A better definition is required before this can be 
    included with the other material.

    Precise thinking can be associated with abstraction to 
    a well-defined thing.
    We can take this to its limit by introducing objects:

    An <em>object</em> is an idea $A$ such that $A=A$.

    Although any thought yields, in theory, an object, it is
    not necessarily the case that the mind treats it as an object:
    It may abstract from the object and treat it identically to some
    non-identical idea; this is the genesis of vague thinking.
