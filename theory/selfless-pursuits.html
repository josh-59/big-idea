		<h1> Selfless Pursuits</h1>
		<hr>

        <p>
            Ego is the mind's "self," and it is easily the case that it pursues something without regard
            for that idea of itself.
            Intuitive examples include music, mathematics, and military service.
        </p>

        <p>
            Selfless pursuits yield organization of the intellect, and are common in children; 
            the intuitive examples above are relative to the mature, adult ego.  
        </p>


        <h2>Enlightenment</h2>
        <p>
            In each mind, there exists an observing process.
            Observation of this process by itself is the "truth realized" state.
            It is a special case of selfless pursuit, and, it is not final.
            The McKennian "enlightened" state is that period of time immediately
            following truth-realization, when the mind still posesses the faculty to 
            problem solve.  
            This state is degenerate, and, the degenerated state is isomorphic to the
            newborn.
        </p>

        <p>
            The neatest way out of this state is addiction.
        </p>
