		<h1>Long Term Memory</h1>

		<hr>
		<p>
			Long term memory is not the main focus of this theory,
			but is within the purview of it.
			Here, a plausible method of implementing it is presented.
			We will refer to the contents of the current memory as the
			<em>context</em> of the intellect.
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				The context is hashed, and this hash is used as the name
				of a file
			</li>
			<li>
				To retrieve long-term memory, the file's contents are
				written to an arbitrary, fixed location in the context
			<li>
				To store long-term memory, the context is reduced and
				saved to the file.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			There are a few key points to this implementation:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Long term memory is handled concurrently and unconsciously.
				It is not an explicitly controlled process
			</li>
			<li>
				It becomes the role of the intellect to "game" this system,
				in attempts to recall specific memories
			</li>
			<li>
				The process is self-reinforcing
			</li>
			<li>
				Memories can imply more memories:
				When recalling, the hash may yield a related memory.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mistakes do happen
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			A minor point also exists:
			As the intellect organizes, the <em>form</em> of memories would change.
			That is, early (childhood) memories would exist, but not in the form
			of the current intellect.
