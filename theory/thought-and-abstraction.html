		<h1> Thought and Abstraction  </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			In common usage, the word "thought" has two distinct meanings.
			The first is found in the response to the question, "What are you thinking?"
			This equivalently asks things like, "Are you upset?", "Are you mad?",
			"Would you like to sit down?", etc..
			The second usage is found in, "There's a thought!", or, "There's an idea!"
		</p>

		<p>
			These are two different things, and we must separate them in order
			to talk about them clearly.
			We will use the word <em>thought</em> to speak of the first entity, broadly,
			the contents of the mind at any given time.
			We will use the word <em>abstraction</em> to speak of the second entity.
			Pictorially, we have:

		<p>
			Note that <em>thought</em> is sufficient to uniquely determine the abstracting process.
			However, this picture is not exactly correct, because each abstracting process
			must have some time alone&mdash; it must operate without context,
			in order <em>to think.</em>
			Hence,

		<p>
			That is, thought is composed, in part, of immediately preceding abstractions.
			If we allow only abstractions, then it must be the case that thought
			is composed (entirely) of abstractions.
