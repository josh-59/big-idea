		<h1> Thought and Abstraction  </h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			In common usage, the word "thought" has two distinct meanings.
			The first is found in the response to the question, "What are you thinking?"
			This equivalently asks things like, "Are you upset?", "Are you mad?",
			"Would you like to sit down?", etc..
			The second usage is found in, "There's a thought!", or, "What a great idea!"
		</p>

		<p>
			These are two different things, and we must separate them in order
			to talk about them clearly.
			We will use the word <em>thought</em> to speak of the first entity.
			Formally, thought is the set of all abstractions present in the
			mind at any one time.
			Intuitively, it can be understood as contents of the mind at any given time;
			<em>abstraction</em> refers to the second entity.
			Pictorially, we have:

		<p>
			However, this picture is not exactly correct, because each abstracting process
			must have some time alone&mdash; it must operate without context,
			in order <em>to think.</em>
			Hence,

			That is, thought could be expressed as a sequence of abstractions alone.

			<h2> More on Thoughts vs. Abstraction</h2>

			<p>
				By definition, abstractions exist within thought.
				Moreover, owing to this all-encompassing definition, "thought" is
				sufficient to uniquely determine the abstracting process.
			</p>

			<p>
				An abstraction is distinct from thought in a few ways.
				First, it has yet to be adopted (economized, assumed, internalized) by the intellect.
				because of this, an abstracting process views an abstraction, and
				does not assume it.
				Ultimately, I feel that they differ in "volume" alone&mdash; abstractions
				simply appear "louder" or "more pronounced" than do other entities within
				thought.
			</p>

			<p>
				As I see it now, the abstracting process exists within a network of
				thoughts; the network is composed of the ideas themselves and
				their relative importance.
				The process traces a path through this network, changing each
				thought's importance, and so leaving a trail of change.
				This change is the consequence of the process inspecting many thoughts,
				marginalizing most, and highlighting a few.
				If we assume that the "depth" of an abstracting process is around 3,
				many subtleties are possible.

			<p>
				A few characteristics:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The abstracting process must be a process on the mind.
						That is, at each possible interaction, zero change is not possible.
						We stipulate this because without change, the abstracting process
						cannot be said to exist.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The abstracting process is <em>usually negative</em> in the sense
						that for the majority of interactions, the abstracting processes
						discards (marginalizes) the thought.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The elements have "memory," so
						that when they are suppressed, they tend to "bounce back."
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It would be possible to "subconsciously" increase the importance of an
						element, so that it <em>is not</em> necessary to entertain a
						thought explicitly, in order to maintain it in thought.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The importance of an element is defined by its relation among other elements.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The generation of a new node in this network is but a slight
						generalization of abductive reasoning.
						It would not need to be <em>true</em> with respect to anything
						except other nodes, in order to be considered important.
						A statement to this effect would be, "That is what I believed."
