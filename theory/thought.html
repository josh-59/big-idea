        <p>
            The challenge here is to develop a single model 
            of thought which is capable of accurately describing 
            both vague and precise thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			A <em>thought</em> is a finite sequence of ordered pairs of 
            collections of information 

            $$(a_1, b_1), (a_2,b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n)$$

            such that $(a_1, b_n)$ forms an abstraction.
		</p>

        <p>
            A thought is a pattern of thinking whose
            specifics ("internals") may be discarded, leaving an abstraction.
            Note that a thought is not necessarily composed strictly of 
            abstractions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Intuitively, <em>precise thinking</em> will be associated with
            abstraction of a single thing.
            <em>Vague thinking</em> will be associated with
            "impure" abstraction, or, singular abstractions of more than 
            one thing.
            This can, in theory, be used to explain both creativity and abductive 
            reasoning.
            In either case, we do not need to consider sequences of ordered
            pairs of collections of information that do not form
            abstractions.
