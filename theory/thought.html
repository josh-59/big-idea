        <p>
            The essence of thought is
            to first introduce some arbitrary observation, then to "load up"
            relevant abstractions, to attempt these abstractions on the idea,
            and finally to evaluate the results, repeating as necessary.
        </p>


        <p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			A <em>thought</em> is a finite sequence of observations and abstractions  
            $$(a_1, b_1), (a_2,b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n)$$

            such that $b_1 = a_2, b_2 = a_3, ...$, and 

            $(a_1, b_n)$ forms an abstraction.
		</p>

        <p>
            With this definition, our model should become intuitively clear:
            We are imagining a container of information is being operated on
            reiteratively.
            The two operations are to add information and to subtract information.
            Each operation $(a_x, b_x)$ is defined outside of the thought, 
            and is therefore arbitrary with respect to the thought.
        </p>

        <p>
            Depictions such as the one above will be common in what follows,
            and therefore it may be well to explain them precisely.
            On the y-axis is data, and on the x-axis is time.
            The horizontal line of the x-axis represents zero data.
            Each line plotted represents a distinct container of information;
            any point on the line represents the quantity of information
            it contains at that time.
            Dotted lines do not represent containers of information, and 
            they will be used only to illustrate relevant concepts.
            Finally, note that in the depiction above, the curve denoting 
            the thought is composed strictly of abstractions, since the 
            quantity of information is monotonically decreasing.
        </p>

       
        <p>
            The curve representing <em>thought</em> concaves downward
            owing to an assumption about the mind:
            That it continually forgets.
            (In virtue of this assumption, it may be possible to restate
            this theory, or to implement it, in terms of observation alone:
            Obervation reinforces some particular subset of the information,
            with the rest being implicitly discarded.)
        </p>

        <p>
            By way of thought, the mind generates new abstractions for itself:
            A new operation is produced, which may be included in other
            thoughts.  
            Obtaining this new abstraction from a thought 
            involves only observing the thought's container of information 
            at two distinct points in time.
        </p>

        <p>
            In generating and adopting an abstraction 
            from a thought, the mind implicitly simplifies itself.
