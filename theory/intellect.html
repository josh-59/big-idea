		<h1> Intellect </h1>
		<hr>

        <h2> Introduction </h2>
        <p>
            Pragmatically speaking, <em>Intellect</em> is our goal.
            Loosely, it is the strategy of simplification
            chosen by the mind.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            For any mind, the strategy of simplification
            it uses represents a tradeoff: A greater number
            of concurrent abstractions implies that
            each must be more extreme (simpler),  
            while a greater number of concurrent abstractions
            yields greater potential sophistication of the thought
            process.
        </p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>intellect</em> is a
            conscious abstracting process; it yields an 
            indefinite sequence of abstractions.
			We will say that an intellect <em>fields</em> these abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Intuitively, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
			In defining the intellect, we ignore the content of thought,
			and instead concern ourselves with its patterns. 
		</p>

        <!--
		<p>
			The case we will be concerned with is when the abstractions 
            an intellect fields are of constant order, greater than zero.
			As a consequence, we will refer to intellects by their order:

			<figcaption><center>Intellects of Various Orders</center></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The human mind fields an intellect with
			order between one and eight, inclusive.
		</p>

		<h2> Depth</h2>
		<p>
			The abstractions of an intellect may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, smaller abstractions,
			which is to say that the abstractions an intellect fields may, themselves,
			be intellects:

		</figure>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong>
			Moreover, the average human intellect has a depth of four.
		</p>
        -->
        <h2> Ego </h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>ego</em> is an intellect's
            abstraction of itself.
        </p>

        <h2> Introspection </h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong> <em>Introspection</em> is
            the tendency of the intellect to simplify itself.
        </p>

        <p>
            Introspection begins an inquiry into intelligence; 
            it is related to pattern-finding and statement-making.
        </p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect might be as a data
			structure with the property that it is endlessly economizing.
			Formally, this would be expressed as $O(0)$ 
            (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
