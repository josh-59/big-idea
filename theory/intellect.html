		<h1> Intellect </h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>intellect</em> is a indefinite sequence of
			abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Intuitively, an intellect is a pattern of thinking; it <em>is not</em>
			self or ego.
			In defining the intellect, we ignore the content of thought,
			and instead concern ourselves with its pattern.
		</p>

		<p>
			The abstractions that constitute an intellect will be said to be
			the abstractions <em>of</em> the intellect.
			We might also say that an intellect <em>fields</em> these abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The case we will be concerned with is when the abstractions an intellect fields
			are of constant order, greater than zero.
			As a consequence, we will refer to intellects by their order:

		</figure>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The human mind fields an intellect with
			order between one and eight, inclusive.
		</p>

		<h2> Depth</h2>
		<p>
			The abstractions of an intellect may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, smaller abstractions,
			which is to say that the abstractions an intellect fields may, themselves,
			be intellects:

		</figure>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong>
			Moreover, the average human intellect has a depth of four.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect might be as a data
			structure with particular properties.
			Specifically, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing.
			Formally, that would be expressed as operating in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> Any data structure operating in <i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			This view is as-yet undeveloped, and questions remain:
			What is its interface?  What do I mean by O(0)?
