		<h1> Intellect </h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>intellect</em> is sequence of
			abstractions of finite, constant order.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<p>
			We will refer to these as <em>first-order intellect, second-order intellect,</em>
			and so on.
			Intuitively, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
			In particular, we do not care about <em>the content</em> of thought, when considering
			the intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The number of repetitions required to adopt (assume)
			a consequence is one-half the order of the intellect.
		</p>

		<h2> Depth</h2>
		<p>
			An intellect need not be as simple as a sequence of singular abstractions.
			Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, smaller abstractions:
		</p>

		</figure>

		<p>
			This we will refer to as the <em>depth</em> of the intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The human mind is principally defined by an intellect with
			order between one and eight.  Moreover, the average human intellect has a depth of four.
		</p>

		<p>
			When speaking of the order of an intellect, we do not refer to the order of its
			abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect might be as a data
			structure with particular properties.
			Specifically, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing.
			Formally, that would be expressed as operating in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> Any data structure operating in <i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			This view is as-yet undeveloped, and questions remain:
			What is its interface?  What do I mean by O(0)?
