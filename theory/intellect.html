		<h1> Intellect </h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>intellect</em> is sequence of
			abstractions of finite, constant order.
		</p>

			<figcaption><center>Intellects of Various Orders</center></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			We will refer to these as <em>first-order intellect, second-order intellect,</em>
			and so on.
			Intuitively, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
			In particular, we do not care about <em>the content</em> of thought, when considering
			the intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The number of repetitions required to adopt (assume)
			a consequence is one-half the order of the intellect.
		</p>

		<h2> Depth</h2>
		<p>
			An intellect need not be as simple as a sequence of singular abstractions.
			Rather, a single abstraction may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, smaller abstractions:
		</p>

		<figure>
			<center><img src="img/deep-intellect.png" style="width:100%;"></center>
		</figure>

		<p>
			This we will refer to as the <em>depth</em> of the intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The human mind is principally defined by an intellect with
			order between one and eight.  Moreover, the average human intellect has a depth of four.
		</p>

		<p>
			When speaking of the order of an intellect, we do not refer to the order of its
			abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect might be as a data
			structure with particular properties.
			Specifically, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing.
			Formally, that would be expressed as operating in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> Any data structure operating in <i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			This view is as-yet undeveloped, and questions remain:
			What is its interface?  What do I mean by O(0)?

			<h2> Implementation of Intellect</h2>

			<p>
				A few characteristics of a possible implementation of intellect:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The abstracting process must be a process on the mind.
						That is, at each possible interaction, zero change is not possible.
						We stipulate this because without change, the abstracting process
						cannot be said to exist.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The abstracting process is <em>usually negative</em> in the sense
						that for the majority of interactions, the abstracting processes
						discards (marginalizes) the belief.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The elements have "memory," so
						that when they are suppressed, they tend to "bounce back."
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It would be possible to "subconsciously" increase the importance of an
						element, so that it <em>is not</em> necessary to entertain a
						thought explicitly, in order to maintain it in thought.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The importance of an element is defined by its relation among other elements.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The generation of a new node in this network is but a slight
						generalization of abductive reasoning.
						It would not need to be <em>true</em> with respect to anything
						except other nodes, in order to be considered important.
						A statement to this effect would be, "That is what I believed."
					</p>
				</li>
