		<h1> Intellect </h1>
		<hr>

		<p>
			Intuitively, an intellect is a pattern of thinking.
			In defining the intellect, we ignore the content of thought,
			and instead concern ourselves with its pattern.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong> An <em>intellect</em> is a sequence of
			abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The abstractions that constitute an intellect will be said to be
			the abstractions <em>of</em> the intellect.
			We might also say that an intellect <em>fields</em> its abstractions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The interesting case is when the abstractions an intellect fields
			are of order greater than zero.
			Moreover, we will restrict our attention to intellects which tend
			to be stable with respect to order.
			As a consequence, we will refer to intellects by their order:

			<figcaption><center>Intellects of Various Orders</center></figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p>
			We will refer to these as <em>first-order intellect, second-order intellect,</em>
			and so on.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The number of repetitions required to adopt (assume)
			a consequence is one-half the order of the intellect.
		</p>

		<h2> Depth</h2>
		<p>
			The abstractions of an intellect may be constructed as a sequence of multiple, smaller abstractions,
			which is to say that the abstractions an intellect fields may, themselves,
			be intellects:

		</figure>

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> The human mind is principally defined by an intellect with
			order between one and eight.  Moreover, the average human intellect has a depth of four.
		</p>

		<p>
			When speaking of the order of an intellect, we do not refer to the order of its
			abstractions.
		</p>

		<h2> Intellect As a Data Structure </h2>

		<p>
			One approach towards describing the intellect might be as a data
			structure with particular properties.
			Specifically, it would be a data structure which is endlessly economizing.
			Formally, that would be expressed as operating in $O(0)$ (Big-Oh-Zero) time.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Conjecture:</strong> Any data structure operating in <i>O(0)</i> time will prove to be an intellect.
		</p>

		<p>
			This view is as-yet undeveloped, and questions remain:
			What is its interface?  What do I mean by O(0)?

			<h2> Implementation of Intellect</h2>

			<p>
				A few characteristics of a possible implementation of intellect:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						The abstracting process must be a process on the mind.
						That is, at each possible interaction, zero change is not possible.
						We stipulate this because without change, the abstracting process
						cannot be said to exist.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The abstracting process is <em>usually negative</em> in the sense
						that for the majority of interactions, the abstracting processes
						discards (marginalizes) the belief.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The elements have "memory," so
						that when they are suppressed, they tend to "bounce back."
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						It would be possible to "subconsciously" increase the importance of an
						element, so that it <em>is not</em> necessary to entertain a
						thought explicitly, in order to maintain it in thought.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The importance of an element is defined by its relation among other elements.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The generation of a new node in this network is but a slight
						generalization of abductive reasoning.
						It would not need to be <em>true</em> with respect to anything
						except other nodes, in order to be considered important.
						A statement to this effect would be, "That is what I believed."
					</p>
				</li>
