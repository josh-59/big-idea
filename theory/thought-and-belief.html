        <h2> Thought </h2>

        <p>
            The challenge here is to develop a single model 
            of thought which is capable of accurately describing 
            both vague and precise thinking.
        </p>

        <p>
			<strong>Definition:</strong>
			A <em>thought</em> is a sequence of ordered pairs of 
            collections of information.
		</p>

        <p>
            Intuitively, <em>vague thinking</em> will be associated with
            "impure" abstraction, or, singular abstractions of more than 
            one thing.
            This can, in theory, be used to explain both creativity and abductive 
            reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Concurrrently, <em>precise thinking</em> will be associated with
            abstraction of a single thing ("pure" abstraction). 
            This we will express by demanding that 
            the amount of information
            entertained be decreasing.
        </p>
	
        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            A <em>true thought</em> is a sequence of ordered pairs of collections
            of information
                $$(a_1, b_1), (a_2,b_2), ..., (a_n, b_n)$$
            such that $(a_1, b_n)$ forms an abstraction.
        </p>

        <p>
            A true thought is a pattern of thinking whose
            specifics ("internals") may be discarded, leaving an abstraction.
            Moreover, a true thought has the property that it may be included in any
            other thought, and its truth, if any, will be preserved.
        </p>


        <h2> Belief</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            A <em>belief</em> is an abstraction present in the argument
            of an abstraction.
        </p>

        <h2> Model </h2>

        <p>
            A model is to thought what a mneumonic is to memory.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Definition:</strong>
            A model is an abstraction which supports metathought.
