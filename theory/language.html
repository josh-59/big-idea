		<h1>Languages</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			Initially inspired by the notion of <em>metalanguage</em> in
			Dr. Suppes's <em>Axiomatic Set Theory</em>, here I generalize the notion in order
			to provide a more formal, if still intuitive, description of learning:
			All learning can be expressed as adopting new language.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the aforementioned <em>Axiomatic Set Theory,</em> it is explicitly
			pointed out (page 11) that, "Our metalanguage is a certain vaguely defined
			fragment of ordinary English augmented by certain symbols familiar from intuitive
			mathematics."
			Within that work, this metalangauge is used to develop the "object language" of
			set theory.
			As yet, I have no desire to develop object languages, but I see great
			potential in the idea of metalangauge to help describe how the mind
			operates.
		</p>

		<p>
			Intuitively, a <em>language</em> is that which is used in the course of some work.
			It is adopted by the actor as native material, and internalized as part of themselves.
			Moreover, the actor uses language to attain some goal.
		</p>

		<p>
			As a first example, <em>LaTeX</em> is a language.  On the one hand,
			it must be learned (and is not the easiest typesetting scheme to learn).
			On the other, it exists for the sole purpose of typesetting documents.
			One <em>learns</em> LaTeX, and then goes about forgetting it as quickly
			as possible, in order to achieve their ultimate goal of publishing some paper.
		</p>

		<p>
			This first example is intended to illustrate the generality I seek in the
			development of "languages."  Many other programs may be considered
			languages:
		</p>

		<ul style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
			<li>Word</li>
			<li>Git</li>
			<li>CAD</li>
			<li>MATLAB</li>
			<li>Video production / Music Production Suites</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			An interesting thought-experiment:  A layman could probably pick up
			a LaTeX source document and work out what it says (given that all
			they are lacking is knowledge of LaTeX).
			On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to expect them to
			turn around and use the program to create documents of their own.
			That is, the language of LaTeX is spoken in the syntax and semantics of
			LaTeX source, and not in the English (or mathematical) content of the document.
		</p>

		<p>
			Languages can be thought of as <em>subjects</em> that are well-defined, in
			the sense that they have bounds, and
			which are internalized (effectively, assumed) for their
			subsequent use in the pursuit of an arbitrary goal.
		</p>

		<p>
			A few more examples:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li> A crime fiction's language is English; its purpose is to entertain</li>
			<li> Mechanics is a language of auto technicians</li>
			<li> Both music itself and instruments are languages of the musician</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			For any language, we require some layer underneath it, in order to discuss it.
		    However, we do not need additional layers to use it.
			As in the case of English class, we can use a language as its own language.
		</p>

		<p>
			The primary distinction that the <em>language</em> abstraction
			allows us to make is between working and studying:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Working: Using what you know</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Picking new knowledge up incidentally
				</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Studying: Reconsidering what you know</li>
		</ul>

		<h2> Examples Within Logic </h2>
		<p>
			For a mathematics student such as myself, propositional logic
			is an intellectual tool.
			Much like a table or a diagram, it serves to aid my thinking.
			The usefulness of propositional logic is that it begins abstracting from the statement:
			I can view any mathematical statement <em>as a proposition</em>,
			and that proposition becomes an abstraction of my statement.
			This recasts my statement into the field of propositional logic,
			where substantial and relevant theory exists.
